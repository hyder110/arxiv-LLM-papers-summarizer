Summary:
The paper introduces Focused Transformer (FOT), a technique that extends the effective context length of language models. FOT uses a training process inspired by contrastive learning to enhance the structure of the key-value space, allowing for fine-tuning of large-scale models.

Bullet Points:
1. FOT is a technique that extends the effective context length of language models.
2. FOT uses a training process inspired by contrastive learning.
3. The key-value structure is enhanced through FOT, which allows for the extension of the context length.
4. FOT can be used to fine-tune pre-existing, large-scale models.
5. The resulting models, called LONG LLAMAs, demonstrate advancements in tasks requiring a long context.
6. FOT improves the model's ability to distinguish relevant keys from irrelevant ones.
7. FOT achieves high accuracy in passkey retrieval tasks, even beyond the training context length.
8. FOT performs well in few-shot learning tasks, improving accuracy with longer context lengths.
9. FOT also facilitates handling distractions in language modeling tasks.
10. FOT can be combined with other methods to further improve performance and scalability.
