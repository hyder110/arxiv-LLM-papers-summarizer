Summary:
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the utilization of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically transformer-based large language models (LLMs) trained using Big Code, in the domain of AI-assisted programming tasks. LLMs have played a crucial role in facilitating various AI-assisted programming applications, including code generation, code completion, code translation, code refinement, code summarization, defect detection, and clone detection. The paper gives an overview of major LLMs and their applications in these tasks, explores the challenges and opportunities associated with incorporating NLP techniques with software naturalness, and discusses extending AI-assisted programming capabilities to Apple's Xcode for mobile software development.
