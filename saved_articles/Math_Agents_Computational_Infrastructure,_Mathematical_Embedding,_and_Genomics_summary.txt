Summary:

This paper introduces the concept of Math Agents and mathematical embeddings for the application of generative AI in genomics.

LLMs (Large Language Models) are linguistic user interfaces that can be utilized in the computational infrastructure beyond human-AI chat interactions.

Math Agents interact with math, which could potentially shift the focus from "big data" to "big math" for interacting with reality.

The project develops a theoretical model for the deployment of Math Agents and mathematical embeddings in the field of information systems biology, specifically for aging and disease modeling.

Genomic variant and expression data are indicated for practical application in addressing the challenge of Alzheimer's disease.
