struggles with more complex tasks that require high levels of interaction and manual adjustments. The current version of MetaGPT relies solely on the GPT language model without additional external knowledge sources, which can limit its ability to produce accurate and validated outputs. Furthermore, MetaGPT's performance is influenced by the quality and clarity of the initial task instructions provided by the user. If the instructions are ambiguous or incomplete, the resulting outputs may not meet the desired expectations.

Future work on MetaGPT could focus on improving the framework's ability to handle more complex tasks by integrating external knowledge sources and implementing more sophisticated interaction mechanisms. Incorporating reinforcement learning techniques could also enhance MetaGPT's ability to learn from feedback and improve over time. Additionally, expanding the range of supported domains and tasks would make MetaGPT more versatile and applicable to a wider range of real-world challenges.
