Summary:
- The paper presents an automated data-collection pipeline using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and large language models (LLM) to extract tabular data from peer-reviewed literature.
- The pipeline was applied to 74 reports published between 1957 and 2014, extracting experimentally-measured oxidation potentials for 592 organic molecules.
- The trained machine learning models reached prediction errors similar to experimental uncertainty.
- The pipeline was used to estimate oxidation potentials of around 132,000 small organic molecules from the QM9 data set.
- Analysis of the predictions suggests that aliphaticity increases the oxidation potential of an organic molecule, while an increase in the number of heavy atoms lowers it.
- The pipeline offers significant reductions in human labor for manual data collection and exemplifies the automation of scientific research.
