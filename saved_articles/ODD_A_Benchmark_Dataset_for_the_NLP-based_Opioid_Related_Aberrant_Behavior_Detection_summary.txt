Summary:
- This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset called ODD for NLP-based opioid related aberrant behavior detection.
- The dataset consists of expert-annotated electronic health record (EHR) notes and classifies aberrant behaviors into nine categories.
- Two state-of-the-art natural language processing models (fine-tuning and prompt-tuning) were explored to identify aberrant behaviors.
- The prompt-tuning models outperformed the fine-tuning models, especially in uncommon categories.
- The best model achieved an 83.92% area under the precision-recall curve, but there is still room for improvement in uncommon classes.
- The opioid overdose crisis in the United States has had a significant impact on health and finances, making the detection of opioid-related aberrant behaviors important in evaluating the risk associated with opioid abuse.
