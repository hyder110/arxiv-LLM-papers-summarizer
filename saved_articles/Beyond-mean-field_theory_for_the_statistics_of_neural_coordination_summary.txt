Summary:

This paper focuses on understanding the coordination structure of neurons in neuronal networks using statistical physics of disordered systems.
The researchers study networks of spiking leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and use mean-field and linear-response methods to map the networks to linear rate models with an equivalent correlation structure.
They show that heterogeneity in covariances in neuronal networks is not a result of variability in single-neuron firing statistics but stems from sparse realization and variable strength of connections.
The average correlations between neurons are found to be insensitive to heterogeneity but it modulates the variability of covariances across many orders of magnitude.
The study uses disorder-average and replica techniques to derive quantitatively matching beyond-mean-field predictions for the mean and variance of cross-covariances.
The researchers present a systematic inclusion of variability in network connectivity and derive a relation between mean and variance of covariances and the mean and variance of network connectivity.
They investigate the sources of variance in neuronal coordination structures and analyze covariances in a network model of cortical dynamics.
The study shows that the wide distribution of synaptic amplitudes and sparsity in connectivity between neurons contribute to variability in neuronal dynamics.
The researchers use linear-response theory and simulation to analyze spike-count covariances in the spiking network and compare the results with theoretical estimates.
