Summary:
This article explores the use of the Strahler number to characterize the complexity of natural language sentence structures. The Strahler number, originally used to analyze river bifurcation, represents the minimum number of memory areas required to process a sentence structure under a shift-reduce approach. The authors measure the Strahler number of natural language sentences through empirical analysis and find that it is typically 3 or 4, similar to the case of river bifurcation. They also propose two binarization methods and calculate the upper and lower limits of the Strahler number for different tree structures. The results show that the Strahler number grows logarithmically with the size of the tree and is comparable to that of random trees. This finding provides insights into the memory requirements of sentence processing and supports the notion of a cognitive limit on short-term memory.

Bullet Points:
- The Strahler number characterizes the complexity of river bifurcation and can also be applied to natural language sentence structures.
- The Strahler number of natural language sentences is typically 3 or 4, similar to river bifurcation.
- The Strahler number represents the minimum number of memory areas required to process a sentence structure.
- Two binarization methods are proposed to transform dependency structures into binary trees for Strahler number calculation.
- The Strahler number grows logarithmically with the size of the tree.
- The Strahler number for natural language sentences is comparable to that of random trees.
- The findings suggest a cognitive limit on short-term memory and provide insights into the memory requirements of sentence processing.
