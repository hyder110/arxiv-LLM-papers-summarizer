Summary:
This paper introduces GIRL (Generative job Recommendation based on Large language models), a new approach to job recommendations using Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to provide explainable guidance to job seekers and go beyond traditional matching-based methods. The approach involves supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to generate suitable job descriptions based on the job seeker's CV.

Bullet Points:
1. The paper introduces GIRL, a new approach to job recommendations using Large Language Models (LLMs).
2. Current job recommendation systems lack explainability and comprehensive career guidance.
3. GIRL uses a supervised fine-tuning strategy to generate job descriptions based on the job seeker's CV.
4. A model is trained to evaluate the matching degree between CVs and job descriptions.
5. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to further fine-tine the generator.
6. GIRL aligns the generator with recruiter feedback to tailor the output for better employer satisfaction.
7. The approach goes beyond traditional matching-based methods in job recommendations.
8. The goal is to streamline the job seeking process and provide more comprehensive career AI advice.
9. The paper addresses the limitations of existing job recommendation models.
10. The proposed approach shows potential for improving job recommendations by utilizing Large Language Models.
