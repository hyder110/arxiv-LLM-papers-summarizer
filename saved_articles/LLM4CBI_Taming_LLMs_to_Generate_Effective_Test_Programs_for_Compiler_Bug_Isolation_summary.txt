Summary:
- Compiler bugs pose a threat to safety-critical applications, and effectively isolating these bugs is important for ensuring the quality of compilers.
- Existing bug isolation approaches face limitations in terms of mutation strategies and human effort requirements.
- This paper proposes a new approach called LLM4C BI that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate effective test programs for compiler bug isolation.
- LLM4C BI includes components for program complexity-guided prompt production, memorized prompt selection, and test program validation.
- Evaluation results show that LLM4C BI outperforms existing approaches in isolating bugs from popular C open-source compilers.
- LLM4C BI is also extensible and can be integrated with other LLMs.
