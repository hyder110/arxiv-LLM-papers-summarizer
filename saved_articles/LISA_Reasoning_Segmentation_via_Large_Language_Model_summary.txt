Summary:
The paper introduces a new task called reasoning segmentation, which involves generating a binary segmentation mask based on an implicit query text. The proposed model, LISA, is a large Language Instructed Segmentation Assistant, which combines the language generation capabilities of a multi-modal Large Language Model (LLM) with the ability to produce segmentation masks. LISA demonstrates impressive capabilities in complex reasoning, world knowledge, explanatory answers, and multi-turn conversations. It also achieves robust zero-shot performance and further enhancement through fine-tuning on reasoning segmentation image-instruction pairs. The paper also presents a benchmark dataset, called ReasonSeg, comprising over one thousand image-instruction pairs for evaluation purposes.

3. LISA demonstrates impressive performance in complex reasoning, world knowledge, explanatory answers, and multi-turn conversations.
4. Achieves robust zero-shot performance and further improvement through fine-tuning on reasoning segmentation image-instruction pairs.
5. Introduces a benchmark dataset, ReasonSeg, for evaluating reasoning segmentation.
6. Shows that existing referring segmentation models are not capable of handling reasoning segmentation.
7. Demonstrates that LISA outperforms previous works in both reasoning segmentation and vanilla referring segmentation tasks.
