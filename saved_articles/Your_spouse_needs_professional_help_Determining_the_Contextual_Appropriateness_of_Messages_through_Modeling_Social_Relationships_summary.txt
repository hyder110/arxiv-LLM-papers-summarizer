Summary:

The paper introduces a new approach to identifying inappropriate communication by explicitly modeling the social relationship between individuals.

The authors present a new dataset of contextually-situated judgments of appropriateness and show that large language models can accurately identify appropriateness in a given context.

The study demonstrates that contextual-appropriateness judgments are predictive of other social factors expressed in language such as condescension and politeness.

Interpersonal relationships play a crucial role in determining the appropriateness of communication, and different relationship types have different norms and expectations.

The authors trained various models, including prompt-based models and masked language models, to accurately recognize the contextual appropriateness of messages.

The models performed well, with the flan-t5-xl model showing the highest performance in recognizing contextual appropriateness.

Model performance varied depending on the relationship type, with some relationships having more complex norms that were challenging for the models to capture.

The study also explored how well the models generalize to unseen relationship types, finding that models struggled to accurately predict appropriateness for relationships not seen during training.

The authors estimate the context sensitivity of conversations by labeling dialog turns from the PRIDE dataset, finding that a significant portion of conversation is sensitive to the context of the relationship.
