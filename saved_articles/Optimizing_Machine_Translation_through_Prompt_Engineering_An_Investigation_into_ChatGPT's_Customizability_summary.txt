Summary:
This research explores how incorporating the purpose of the translation and the target audience into prompts can improve the quality of translations generated by ChatGPT. The study finds that using suitable prompts in language models like ChatGPT can lead to more flexible translations. The research focuses on the changes in translation quality when prompts are used and the impact on the translation process. The study demonstrates the practical application of the "good translation" concept, specifically in marketing documents and culturally dependent idioms.

Bullet Points:
1. The study investigates the use of prompts to improve the quality of translations generated by ChatGPT.
2. Suitable prompts can lead to more flexible translations in large-scale language models.
3. The research focuses on the changes in translation quality when prompts are used.
4. It evaluates the impact of prompts from the perspective of a practicing translator.
5. The integration of the purpose and target audience into prompts modifies the generated translations and enhances translation quality.
6. The study demonstrates the practical application of the "good translation" concept in marketing documents and culturally dependent idioms.
7. Traditional machine translation (MT) has limitations in achieving flexible translations compared to language models like ChatGPT with suitable prompts.
8. The research highlights the importance of the pre-production phase in the translation process.
9. The study combines subjective and qualitative evaluation with the use of OpenAI's word embedding API for cosine similarity calculations.
10. Further experiments and validations are needed to apply the findings on a larger scale.
