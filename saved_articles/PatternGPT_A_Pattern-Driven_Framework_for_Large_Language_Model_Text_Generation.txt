Abstract  
Large language models (LLMs)  have 
shown excellent text generation 
capabilities, but there is still much space 
for improvement in accuracy, sometimes 
with grammatical errors, semantic 
inaccuracies, and contextual incoherence, 
which seriously affect the reliability  of 
the models. These problems may 
originate from the difficulties and 
limitations encountered in the pattern 
extraction stage of large language models. 
How to utilize the generative power of 
large language models to generate as 
many possible patterns that  help solve 
problems and find the optimal patterns 
from them, so as to use patterns to guide 
large language models to generate good 
content, has become a current research 
hotspot. In this paper, we propose a 
pattern extraction and selection 
framework, Patt ernGPT, which generates 
rich patterns through the extraction 
ability of large language models  and 
draws on the idea of federation learning, 
where multiple agents collaborate with 
each other to generate diverse patterns. 
High -quality patterns are selected by 
defining criteria and optimization   
 
algorithms to personalize the guidance of 
the model generation process. 
PatternGPT has the advantages of 
generating diverse and useful patterns, 
extending relevant knowledge, 
facilitating efficient pattern use and 
transfer, and optimizing the quality of 
generated results and user experience, 
which provides an effective method for 
optimizing the text generation capability 
of large language models and is expected 
to drive further development in the field 
of intelligent di alogue and content 
generation. It is expected to promote 
further development in the field of 
intelligent dialogue and content 
generation.

1.Introduction  
Recently, the field of artificial 
intelligence research has undergone a 
revolutionary change with the 
advancement of Large Language Models  
[1-5], especially with the release of 
ChatGPT and GPT -4. These models have 
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 
dialogue, reasoning, and generation by leveraging methods such as thought 
chain cues [6 -9] and Reinf orcement 
Learning Based on Human Feedback 
(RLHF) [10 -11], and at the core of what 
makes these models so powerful is their 
ability to discover and understand 
knowledge. Specifically, this knowledge 
discovery is actually the discovery of 
intrinsic patterns. These patterns can be 
rules, associations, or other underlying 
structures that exist in the data. Through 
the extraction and understanding of these 
patterns, LLMs are able to perform 
complex inference processes. This 
reasoning process can involve deriving 
new conclusions from known 
information, filling in missing 
information, generating reasonable 
speculations, etc. Thus, the capability of 
LLM lies in extracting and using these 
patterns from the data for advanced 
reasoning and generation.  
However, even thou gh LLM has 
demonstrated excellent capabilities in 
generation, there are still some problems. 
When performing text generation, it may 
suffer from syntactic errors, semantic 
inaccuracies, and contextual incoherence. 
In addition, LLM suffers from illusion 
problems, which lead to generated 
statements contradicting facts and 
seriously affect the reliability of LLM. 
These problems may be due to the 
difficulties or limitations of LLM in the 
pattern extraction stage. Pattern 
extraction is a key part of LLM 
generati on capability, which involves 
extracting and applying the appropriate 
patterns from the data to generate the 
corresponding content. If LLM is unable 
to extract the appropriate patterns 
accurately, then the generated results may 
be problematic.  
To address t he above challenges, we propose a pattern generation and 
selection framework, PatternGPT. This 
framework is pattern -centric, generates 
diverse and rich patterns through the 
extraction capability of LLM, optimizes 
the quality and diversity of patterns by 
exploiting their formalizability and 
drawing on the idea of federation 
learning for pattern sharing and exchange, 
and uses patterns for model fine -tuning to 
improve model performance and 
adaptation  and provide the basis for 
building intelligent dialogue sys tems and 
content generation systems.  
Our contributions are summarized as 
follows:  
Diversity and usefulness:  
PatternGPT is able to generate diverse 
and useful patterns by leveraging LLM's 
internal knowledge and training 
experience to generate multiple po ssible 
patterns by combining problem 
understanding, information extraction 
and language patterns to meet different 
needs.  
Knowledge extension:  
PatternGPT can further extend the 
relevant knowledge using training data 
and semantic understanding capabiliti es 
to provide a more comprehensive and 
accurate pattern selection.  
Formal representation and sharing:  
By representing patterns formally and 
sharing patterns by drawing on the idea 
of federal learning, PatternGPT helps to 
process, compare and communicate  
patterns, making the use and delivery of 
patterns more convenient and efficient.  
High -quality  selection and personal -
ized guidance:  
PatternGPT selects high -quality patterns 
by optimizing algorithms and judgment 
criteria, and personalizes guidance by 
fine-tuning the model to provide users with personalized support and guidance . 
2. Related work and background  
LLM can generate the user's desired 
answer based on the knowledge stored in 
the preprocessing parameters through 
zero-shot learning, without additiona l 
parameter updates and labeled datasets. 
However, although LLM has shown 
excellent capabilities in generating text, 
its output has low stability [12] and is largely influenced by instructions or 
prompts [13]. Therefore, to improve the 
performance and stab ility of LLM, 
several  works [14] proposed to retrieve 
knowledge about the input problem from 
the training dataset and use this 
knowledge as a prompt  to guide the 
generation process of the model. This 
knowledge retrieval -based approach 
enables LLMs to better understand and 
meet the needs of specific tasks.  
Fig.1 Pattern as a prompt compared to the effect of standard prompts  
Among them, patterns as a kind of 
knowledge play an important role in 
providing instructions and prompts. As 
shown in Figure 1, in the C programming 
course that our group is currently 
studying, according to our past teaching 
experience, students are often unfamiliar 
with a certain knowledge point because 
they do not have a firm grasp of its 
precursor knowledge. For example, when 
we input the question "What is a pointer" 
and want the LLM  to ask the questioner 
active questions to explore the weak point of the questioner, we want the LLM 
to ask us active questions about the 
precursor knowledge of the pointer 
"address", but the output of the LLM is 
related to "variable", which is not 
effecti ve in finding the weak point for the 
questioner. When we provide the LLM 
with a formal model of pointers, 
addresses, and the "precursors" that link 
them together, the LLM outputs the 
results we want.  
A pattern refers to a structured, 
repeatable form of exp ression or 
behavior with a certain pattern or 
template. It can be a textual form, a 
graphical form, a logical form, or some 
other form that is used to represent a 
specific way of knowledge, information, 
or action.  
The structured nature of the pattern 
makes  it parsable and comprehensible  
and can provide clear guidance 
information for LLM. At the same time, 
the repeatability and regularity of 
patterns allow them to be applied to 
different contexts, data, or problems to 
achieve similar results. By using patte rns 
as instructions or prompts, the style, 
content, and form of the generated results 
can be controlled to make them more 
consistent with the task requirements.  
In addition, the abstract nature of patterns 
allows them  to extract key features and 
relationship s and ignore unimportant or 
minor details. This abstraction makes 
patterns somewhat universal and 
adaptable, capable of being shared, 
reused, and optimized. Therefore, the 
application of patterns can not only 
promote the performance of LLM  but 
also facili tate the accumulation and 
progress of domain knowledge.  
By using patterns as instructions and 
prompts, more targeted and personalized 
guidance information can be provided 
during the fine -tuning of LLM to 
improve the performance and stability of 
the model. Through PatternGPT, we can 
use LLM to extract patterns with 
structured, repeatable, regular , and 
abstract nature, making it possible to 
provide clear guidance for models, reveal 
the hidden patterns and correlations in 
data or problems, promote knowledge 
sharing and optimization, realize the 
transformation and application of non -
verbal structural information, and deeply explore the hidden patterns and 
correlations in data and problems. This 
will facilitate the development of text 
generation and knowledge disc overy.  
3. PatternGPT Framework  
The framework proposed in this paper is 
divided into four parts:  
(1) pattern extraction , where LLM uses 
internal knowledge and training 
experience to generate multiple possible 
patterns based on problem understanding, 
informat ion extraction, and language 
schema.  
(2) pattern sharing , which takes ad -
vantage of the formalizability of patte
rns and draws on the idea of federati
on learning, so that multiple agents c
an collaborate and complement each 
other in pattern generation tasks, t hus
 providing more powerful and diverse
 generation capabilities.  
(3) Pattern se lection and generate -o
n optimization , which improves the 
performance and performance of LL
M in text generation tasks by definin
g judgment criteria and optimization 
algorithms to s elect or generate high -
quality patterns.  
(4) Model fine -tuning , which uses s -
elected patterns as samples or referen
ces for model fine -tuning to provide 
more targeted and personalized guida
nce information to help language mo
dels adapt to specific tasks or dom ai
ns. 
Formally, given the set of questions 𝑄=
{𝑞1,𝑞2,…,𝑞𝑁} , the set of answers 𝐴=
{𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑁}  denotes the standard 
responses to the corresponding questions 
and𝑁  denotes the total number of 
questions. Therefore, we need to learn the 
function 𝑓:𝑄→𝐴  to map the question 
descriptions to the corresponding answers. In PatternGPT, we learn the 
function 𝑓  by the following steps: we 
first generate multiple patterns 𝑃1=
{𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑛}  from question 𝑞𝑖  using 
LLM, and later combine the patterns 
generated by ot her agents 𝑃2=
{𝑝𝑛+1,𝑝𝑛+2,…,𝑝𝑚} to form the pattern 
pool𝑃0={𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑛,…,𝑝𝑚} , then apply the optimization algorithm from 
the pattern pool 𝑃0  to obtain the high -
quality pattern 𝑝𝑖, and finally, use 𝑝𝑖 to 
guide the LLM to generate the answer 𝑎𝑖. 
The structure of the PatternGPT 
framework with C programming Q&A as 
an example is shown in Figure 2.  
 
Fig. 2 Structure of PatternGPT  
3.1 Pattern Extraction  
The core of PatternGPT is to generate 
various patt erns that may contribute to 
the problem solution, and the powerful 
extraction capability of LLM can be used 
to obtain multiple solution patterns for 
the problem.  
3.1.1 Problem Input  
A user -supplied problem is provided to 
LLM as input. e.g., "How to use 
functions to traverse arrays?" .  
3.1.2 Problem Extension  
In the problem extension stage, the LLM 
uses its training data and internal 
semantic understanding capabilities to 
further extend and expand the knowledge 
related to the given problem. This 
extension he lps LLM to generate more 
diverse and richer patterns, even if these patterns are not directly contained in the 
original problem.  
In the process of problem extension, 
LLMs can use the following approaches:  
(1) Similar problem variants : LLMs 
can generate var iants of problems that 
extend the coverage of relevant patterns 
by changing the formulation, structure, or 
specific details of the problem.  
(2) Analogies and reasoning : By using 
the ability of analogy and reasoning, 
LLM can derive new questions related to 
the problem from known knowledge and 
semantic relationships. For example, 
through analogical relationships, LLM 
can provide ways to use data structures or 
objects similar to arrays in function calls. 
Through reasoning, LLM can explore 
logical relationships  related to arrays and 
function calls, such as the difference 
between passing values and passing 
addresses, the representation of arrays in 
memory, etc.  
3.1.3 Pattern Generation  
In the pattern generation stage, the LLM 
uses its internal knowledge and train ing 
experience to generate multiple patterns 
related to a given problem. This process 
can be done based on the linguistic 
patterns and semantic relatedness learned 
by the LLM in a large amount of text. By 
gaining a deeper understanding of the 
problem, the LLM can extract relevant 
information from its memory and 
knowledge base and generate multiple 
possible patterns and represent them 
formally. The formal representation 
makes patterns easier to process, 
compare and match  and also provides a 
basis for genera ting shares.  
In generating patterns, LLM can employ 
a variety of techniques, such as:  
(1) Syntax rules : LLM can generate 
patterns that conform to syntax 
specifications based on syntax rules and 
syntactic structures.  
(2) Contextual association : LLM can 
gene rate patterns related to the semantics 
of the problem by using contextual 
information in the problem, combined 
with learned contextual associations.  
(3) Topic extension : LLM can extend the 
topic domain of the problem based on 
keywords, topics, and contexts  in the 
problem to generate patterns related to 
the problem, etc.  
3.2 Pattern Sharing  
In the process of generating patterns, 
LLM needs to focus on pattern sharing in 
order to provide a wider range of choices 
and perspectives. This means that 
patterns of different styles, perspectives, 
or expressions can be shared in a way that meets different user needs and 
p
