Summary:
This paper presents a method for adapting self-supervised speech representations to atypical, non-native accented speaker populations. The proposed method uses accent-specific residual adapters to train a base model on accent-specific datasets. The experiments show that the adapted models achieve strong word error rate reductions (WERR) over the baseline model for all four accents tested. The approach is both model and task-agnostic and can be applied to any downstream task.

Bullet Points:
1. Self-supervised learning of speech representations may not perform well on non-native accented speaker populations.
2. The proposed method uses accent-specific residual adapters to adapt speech representations to different accents.
3. The experiments show strong word error rate reductions (WERR) for all four accents tested.
4. The approach is both model and task-agnostic, making it applicable to various downstream tasks.
5. Continual self-supervision enables the learning of rich, task-agnostic representations for different accents.
6. Adapters are a cost-effective way to capture accent-specific features in self-supervised speech models.
7. The proposed method achieves strong WERR by updating only 16% of the model parameters.
8. The adapted models perform well on other evaluation sets with similar speaker characteristics, indicating effective adaptation to accent-specific acoustic characteristics.
9. The method has practical viability, as it can adapt models using unlabeled data alone and requires fewer accent-specific parameters.
10. Future work could explore effectively utilizing a small amount of labeled accented data in conjunction with accent-adaptive self-supervision.
