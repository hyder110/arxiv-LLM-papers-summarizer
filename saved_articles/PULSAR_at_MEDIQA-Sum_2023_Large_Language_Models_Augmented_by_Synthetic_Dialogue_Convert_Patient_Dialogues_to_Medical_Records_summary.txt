Summary:
This paper presents PULSAR, a system submission for the ImageClef 2023 MediQA-Sum challenge that focuses on summarizing patient-doctor dialogues into clinical records. PULSAR utilizes domain-specific pre-training and data augmentation techniques to improve performance. The study finds that while domain-specific pre-training and data augmentation have limited efficacy, scaling up the language model leads to the best performance gains. The proposed approach ranked second and third among 13 submissions for task B of the challenge.

Bullet Points:
1. PULSAR is a system submission for summarizing patient-doctor dialogues into clinical records.
2. The framework relies on domain-specific pre-training and data augmentation techniques.
3. Limited evidence is found towards the efficacy of domain-specific pre-training and data augmentation.
4. Scaling up the language model yields the best performance gains.
5. PULSAR ranked second and third among 13 submissions for task B of the challenge.
6. Language models have the potential to improve operational efficiency and documentation quality in healthcare.
7. Dialogue summarization is an established task in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community.
8. PULSAR utilizes a pre-training objective that learns to reconstruct pseudo-summaries consisting of medical terms.
9. Data augmentation is used to generate additional training data for the model.
10. The performance of PULSAR demonstrates the potential of large language models in clinical settings.
