Summary:

This study compares the performance of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) in text annotation tasks with proprietary models like ChatGPT and human-based services such as MTurk. The study finds that while ChatGPT achieves the best performance in most tasks, open-source LLMs not only outperform MTurk but also demonstrate competitive potential against ChatGPT in specific tasks. Open-source LLMs like HugginChat and FLAN are gaining attention for their cost-effectiveness, transparency, reproducibility, and superior data protection. These models offer advantages such as cost savings, transparency, reproducibility, and data protection benefits compared to proprietary models. The study calls for further research to optimize the use of diverse settings and prompts for different tasks.

Bullet Points:

- Open-source LLMs like HugginChat and FLAN outperform MTurk in text annotation tasks.
- ChatGPT achieves the best performance in most tasks.
- Open-source LLMs demonstrate competitive potential against ChatGPT in specific tasks.
- Open-source LLMs offer cost-effectiveness, transparency, reproducibility, and data protection benefits.
- They provide an alternative to proprietary models like ChatGPT and human-based services like MTurk.
- Open-source LLMs can be tailored, enhanced, and scrutinized by a wide user base, improving the overall quality and fairness of the models.
- They do not share data with third parties, enhancing data protection and confidentiality.
- Further research is needed to optimize the use of diverse settings and prompts for different tasks.
- Performance of open-source LLMs generally remains below that of ChatGPT but represents a competitive alternative for many text annotation tasks.
