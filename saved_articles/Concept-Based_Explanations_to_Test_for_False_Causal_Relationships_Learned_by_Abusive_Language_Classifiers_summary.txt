Summary:
This paper introduces a method for assessing false global sufficiency in abusive language classifiers by using concept-based explanations. The authors evaluate three classifiers trained on large English datasets and focus on the concept of negative emotions. They assess the classifiers' accuracy on a challenge set and propose concept-based explanation metrics to measure the influence of the concept on the labels. 

Bullet Points:
1. Classifiers can learn false causal relationships between over-represented concepts and labels, leading to compromised accuracy.
2. The concept of negative emotions is important but should not be learned as a sufficient feature for abuse labels.
3. The authors propose assessing classifiers' reliance on specific concepts by evaluating their accuracy on a challenge set.
4. They also introduce concept-based explanation metrics to compare classifiers regarding false global sufficiency.
5. The metrics include TCAV dir, which measures the association between a concept and a label, and TCAV mag, which measures the extent of the concept's influence on the label.
6. The authors evaluate the sufficiency of the concept of describing protected groups with negative emotions using challenge sets and TCAV scores.
7. The classifiers have learned a strong association between negative emotions and abuse but vary in the degree of sufficiency learned.
8. The proposed metrics provide insights into false global sufficiency relationships and can be used to compare classifiers.
9. The method is limited to pre-defined concepts and requires human input to define the concepts.
10. The metrics should be used for detecting potential flaws in models rather than as absolute scores.
