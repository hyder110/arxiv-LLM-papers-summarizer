Summary:
This paper explores the use of unsupervised sentiment analysis of plastic surgery social media posts. The study demonstrates that unsupervised analysis allows for the prediction of user sentiment towards plastic surgery with almost 90% accuracy using simple deep learning models. The results show that unsupervised learning may be a viable option for labeling social media documents for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Bullet points:
- The paper focuses on unsupervised sentiment analysis of plastic surgery social media posts.
- Natural language processing (NLP) is used to process and transform the text data.
- Unsupervised analytics, machine learning (ML), is performed using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), k-means clustering, and Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
- The study demonstrates that with simple deep learning models, it is possible to predict user sentiment towards plastic surgery with almost 90% accuracy.
- Unsupervised learning performs better than supervised classification in terms of accuracy in this study.
- Social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit provide specific insight into public opinion on cosmetic surgery.
- Different social media platforms attract distinct user bases, which can be differentiated based on their sentiment towards plastic surgery.
- The paper suggests that unsupervised learning can be used to label social media documents for NLP tasks.
- The results indicate that the models perform well in distinguishing between negative, positive, and neutral sentiments.
- The study suggests that other model architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), may not significantly improve sentiment analysis in this context.
