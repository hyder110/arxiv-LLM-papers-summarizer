ChatGPT vs. Google: A Comparative Study of Search Performance and User Experience  Ruiyun (Rayna) Xu, Yue (Katherine) Feng, and Hailiang Chen* July 2023 Abstract The advent of ChatGPT, a large language model-powered chatbot, has prompted questions about its potential implications for traditional search engines. In this study, we investigate the differences in user behavior when employing search engines and chatbot tools for information-seeking tasks. We carry out a randomized online experiment, dividing participants into two groups: one using a ChatGPT-like tool and the other using a Google Search-like tool. Our findings reveal that the ChatGPT group consistently spends less time on all tasks, with no significant difference in overall task performance between the groups. Notably, ChatGPT levels user search performance across different education levels and excels in answering straightforward questions and providing general solutions but falls short in fact-checking tasks. Users perceive ChatGPT’s responses as having higher information quality compared to Google Search, despite displaying a similar level of trust in both tools. Furthermore, participants using ChatGPT report significantly better user experiences in terms of usefulness, enjoyment, and satisfaction, while perceived ease of use remains comparable between the two tools. However, ChatGPT may also lead to overreliance and generate or replicate misinformation, yielding inconsistent results. Our study offers valuable insights for search engine management and highlights opportunities for integrating chatbot technologies into search engine designs.

Introduction In November 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a chatbot based on the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) large language model. ChatGPT’s rapid rise in popularity underscores the transformative potential of generative AI in various industries and applications. In February 2023, Microsoft integrated ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, combining chat and search functionalities in a unique manner (Microsoft 2023). Following this integration, Bing experienced a significant traffic increase of 15.8% from February to March, while Google’s traffic declined by nearly 1% during the same period (Reuters 2023). Considering that each 1% of search advertising market share represents $2 billion in annual revenue (Yahoo! Finance 2023), this notable shift raises concerns about the impact of ChatGPT-like products on traditional search engines and the future of search and information discovery. Traditional search engines and ChatGPT-like systems differ in their information retrieval approaches. Google, the world’s leading search engine, relies on keyword search and matching, presenting users with a list of relevant links. In contrast, ChatGPT employs a conversation-based approach, enabling users to pose queries in natural language. While Google’s speed is impressive, users must filter through search results individually, which can be time-consuming. ChatGPT, however, aims to understand user intent and provide organized responses in complete sentences, offering a more user-friendly and intuitive search experience. Nevertheless, ChatGPT has potential drawbacks, such as slower response times and the possibility of false or misleading information, in contrast to traditional search engines that offer faster response times and more controlled results. As the landscape of search and information discovery evolves, questions remain unanswered regarding the performance and user experience of ChatGPT-like systems compared to traditional search engines. It is crucial to examine how ChatGPT’s conversational nature affects  2 search result accuracy and relevance, explore the trade-offs between its intuitive responses and traditional search engines’ faster results, and investigate how the transition from list-based results to conversational responses influences user satisfaction and search efficiency. Addressing these questions will aid in evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of adopting chat-based search systems like ChatGPT and guide the development of more effective search tools by revealing how user behaviors may evolve with the integration of AI-powered conversational systems. In this study, we conduct a randomized online experiment with the objective of providing a comprehensive comparison between users’ search behaviors and performance when utilizing large language model-powered chatbots and search engine tools, exemplified by ChatGPT and Google Search. We aim to answer the following research questions: 1) How do user behaviors differ when utilizing ChatGPT compared to Google Search for information-seeking tasks? Are these variations consistent across different types of search tasks? 2) Does ChatGPT level user search performance across different education levels?  3) How do users perceive the information quality, trust, and user experience of ChatGPT compared to traditional search engines like Google Search?  Two search tools are developed for the experiment to replicate the functions and interfaces of ChatGPT and Google Search, respectively. We recruit research participants through the Prolific platform (https://www.prolific.co/) and randomly assign them to one of our search tools to complete three information search tasks. After removing invalid responses, our final sample includes a total of 95 participants, with 48 in the ChatGPT group and 47 in the Google Search group. The results show that participants using ChatGPT consistently spend less time on all the tasks. However, their overall task performance does not differ significantly between the two tools.  3 Interestingly, we find that ChatGPT exhibits higher performance for tasks with straightforward questions but does not perform as well in fact-checking tasks, where we observe that ChatGPT is often incapable of correcting mistakes in the user prompt. We also find that ChatGPT levels user search performance across different education levels, while search performance on Google Search is positively correlated with education level. Participants perceive ChatGPT’s responses to have higher information quality when compared to the information obtained from Google Search, despite displaying a comparable level of trust in both tools. Moreover, users in the ChatGPT group report significantly higher user experiences in terms of usefulness, enjoyment, and satisfaction, but a similar level of perceived ease of use.  As the first empirical study to systematically compare ChatGPT with traditional search engines like Google Search, this research makes several significant contributions to the academic literature on information search and human-computer interaction. By examining the differences in user behavior when utilizing search engines compared to chatbot tools, this study sheds light on how users adapt their information-seeking strategies to fit the affordances of these distinct technologies. Furthermore, our investigation into whether ChatGPT levels user search performance across different education levels enriches the literature on the digital divide by demonstrating the democratizing effects of advanced AI-based chatbot systems. Finally, by assessing users’ perceptions of information quality, trust, and user experience in ChatGPT compared to traditional search engines, the research contributes to our understanding of user attitudes and p
