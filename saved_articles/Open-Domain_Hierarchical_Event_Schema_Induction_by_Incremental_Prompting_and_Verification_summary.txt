Summary:

This paper proposes a new approach, called INCSCHEMA, for open-domain hierarchical event schema induction. The approach treats event schemas as a form of commonsense knowledge that can be derived from large language models (LLMs). INCSCHEMA breaks down the construction of complex event graphs into three stages: event skeleton construction, event expansion, and event-event relation verification. The approach outperforms previous methods in terms of temporal and hierarchical relations, and improves the interpretability of the generated schemas.

Bullet Points:

- Event schemas are a form of world knowledge about the typical progression of events.
- Existing methods for event schema induction rely on information extraction systems or manual annotation, which are not scalable.
- This paper proposes treating event schemas as commonsense knowledge that can be derived from LLMs.
- The INCSCHEMA approach breaks down the construction of complex event graphs into three stages: event skeleton construction, event expansion, and event-event relation verification.
- The INCSCHEMA approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of temporal and hierarchical relations.
- Human assessors rate the schemas generated by INCSCHEMA as more readable and cover more events than previous methods.
- The approach is open-domain, extensible, and more interpretable.
- The evaluation is performed on the RESIN-11 and OD IN datasets, and the results show the effectiveness of INCSCHEMA.
- Future work includes incorporating entity coreference, entity relations, and entity attributes into the generated schemas.
- The model relies on LLMs, which can show inconsistent behavior but can also generate distinct schemas that capture different aspects of the same scenario.
