Summary:
This paper introduces SelfCheck, a scheme for checking step-by-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs). The goal is to improve question-answering performance by identifying and filtering out errors in reasoning. SelfCheck uses a multi-stage, zero-shot verification scheme that combines step regeneration and comparison to check the correctness of each reasoning step. By using confidence scores as weights for voting on different generated answers, SelfCheck increases the accuracy of question answering. The method is tested on three math datasets and successfully recognizes errors and improves final predictive performance.

Bullet Points:
1. SelfCheck is a scheme for checking step-by-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs).
2. The goal is to improve question-answering performance by identifying and filtering out errors in reasoning.
3. SelfCheck uses a multi-stage, zero-shot verification scheme that combines step regeneration and comparison to check the correctness of each reasoning step.
4. Confidence scores are used as weights for voting on different generated answers, improving question-answering accuracy.
5. The method is tested on three math datasets (GSM8K, MathQA, and MATH) and successfully recognizes errors and improves final predictive performance.
6. SelfCheck allows LLMs to recognize and correct their own errors without external resources.
