Summary:

This paper explores the psychology of GPT-4's moral and legal reasoning, aiming to understand how the model generates its impressive behavior and its implications for AI alignment.

Understanding GPT-4's reasoning is important for normative debates and ensuring alignment between AI systems and human values.

Research into GPT-4's beliefs and cognitive processes needs to rely on indirect and interdisciplinary methods, similar to studying human psychology.

The paper compares the responses of GPT-4 with those of humans in two different domains: moral cognition and experimental jurisprudence.

In moral cognition, the paper examines GPT-4's responses to intentional action, causality, deception, and moral foundations. GPT-4's responses closely match those of humans but with some differences, suggesting it may have its own cognitive processes.

In experimental jurisprudence, the paper explores GPT-4's interpretations of concepts such as consent, legal responsibility, and rule violation. GPT-4's responses align with human judgments, but there are some differences between them.

The paper uses vignette-based studies to reproduce and analyze GPT-4's responses and compares them with human data.

Overall, GPT-4's responses show similarities to human responses in moral and legal reasoning, but there are also differences, indicating the need for further research in machine cognition.
