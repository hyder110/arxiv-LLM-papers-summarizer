ABSTRACT
In recent years, large language models (LLM) have emerged as pow-
erful tools for diverse natural language processing tasks. However,
their potential for recommender systems under the generative rec-
ommendation paradigm remains relatively unexplored. This paper
presents an innovative approach to recommendation systems using
large language models (LLMs) based on text data. In this paper, we
present a novel LLM for generative recommendation (GenRec) that
utilized the expressive power of LLM to directly generate the target
item to recommend, rather than calculating ranking score for each
candidate item one by one as in traditional discriminative recom-
mendation. GenRec uses LLMâ€™s understanding ability to interpret
context, learn user p
