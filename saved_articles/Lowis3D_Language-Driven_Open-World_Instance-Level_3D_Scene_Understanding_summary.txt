Summary:
- The paper addresses the challenge of open-world instance-level 3D scene understanding, which involves locating and recognizing unseen object categories.
- The authors propose using pre-trained vision-language (VL) models to generate captions for multi-view images of 3D scenes, establishing associations between 3D shapes and semantic-rich captions.
- They also design hierarchical point-caption association methods to learn semantic-aware embeddings and develop debiased instance localization to enhance object grouping and localization for novel classes.
- The proposed method, called Lowis3D, outperforms baseline methods in semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks across three datasets.
- The paper extends a conference version by providing in-depth analysis, proposing a lightweight proposal grouping module, conducting extensive experiments, and achieving improvements in instance-level understanding and panoptic segmentation.
