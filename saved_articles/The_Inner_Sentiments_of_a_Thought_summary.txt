Summary:

This paper explores the use of large-scale language models (LLMs) to understand the emotional dynamics and sentiments conveyed in sentences. The authors train predictors of the quantiles of the distributions of valence, determination, admiration, anxiety, and annoyance from the hidden representations of an LLM. They show that these predictors are well-calibrated and can be used to analyze sentences, even capturing the effects of conjunctions like "but" on emotional trajectories. The authors also demonstrate how to use the distributional predictions to generate sentences with specific sentiments. The findings have implications for understanding the inner workings of thoughts and could be useful in fields like psychiatry.
