Title: Retrieval Augmented Generation and Representative Vector Summarization for Large Unstructured Textual Data in Medical Education

Summary:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but they can produce inaccurate answers. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by using a non-parametric knowledgebase.
- RAG-assisted summarization is important but challenging. RAG-assisted Representative Vector Summarization (RVS) is introduced to generate summaries using representative text chunks.
- RVS selects a pre-defined number of representative chunks from a vector database and applies a combined abstractive and extractive summarizing workflow.
- The model can identify keywords and create visual representations of the document using word clouds and scatter plots.
- docGPT is a implemented document intelligence program that uses RVS and RAG.
- The workflow includes retrieval of text from unstructured sources and embedding them in a vector space for similarity search.
- Summarization involves quantization of the vector space, selecting representative chunks, and generating keywords.
- Evaluation shows that docGPT generates more targeted and accurate answers compared to other models.
- RVS was tested on medical reference books but can be applied to other domains as well.
