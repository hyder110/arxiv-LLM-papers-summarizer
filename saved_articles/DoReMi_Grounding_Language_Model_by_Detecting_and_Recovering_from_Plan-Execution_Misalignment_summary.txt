Summary:
The paper presents the DoReMi framework, which enables immediate detection and recovery from misalignment between plan and execution in language models. The framework utilizes a vision question answering model to detect misalignment and calls the language model for re-planning. The experiments on robot arm manipulation tasks and humanoid robot tasks show that DoReMi leads to higher task success rates and shorter task completion times.

Bullet Points:
1. The DoReMi framework enables immediate detection and recovery from plan-execution misalignments in language models.
2. A vision question answering model is used to detect misalignment during low-level skill execution.
3. The language model is called for re-planning when misalignment is detected.
4. Experiments on robot arm manipulation tasks and humanoid robot tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DoReMi.
5. DoReMi leads to higher task success rates and shorter task completion times.
6. The framework maintains a constraint set through natural language description.
7. The VQA model is used as a general constraint detector to check constraint satisfaction.
8. The framework can handle environmental perturbations and imperfect controller design.
9. Theoretical analyses show the potential time savings and success rate improvements achievable through immediate detection and recovery.
10. Possible future improvements include using advanced vision-language models and automatically generating constraints.
