Summary:

The paper proposes a data filtering approach called T-MARS to improve visual representations in vision-language models. The approach focuses on images with text that dominate the visual features and filters out those with low similarity scores. T-MARS outperforms other baselines on the DataComp benchmark and shows linear scaling trends with data and compute increases.

Bullet Points:

- T-MARS is a data filtering approach to improve visual representations in vision-language models.
- It focuses on images with dominating text features and filters out images with low similarity scores.
- T-MARS outperforms other baselines on the DataComp benchmark.
- The approach shows linear scaling trends with increases in data and compute.
- Filtering out 'bad data' can be more useful than adding more 'good' samples to the dataset.
- The utility of different data types confirms the importance of retaining samples with both visual and text features.
- T-MARS does not have OCR capabilities but focuses on visual representations.
- Data subset selection can introduce biases but no harmful biases were observed in this specific approach.
