bullet points:

- Large language models (LLMs) are gaining popularity in both academia and industry due to their exceptional performance in various applications.
- Evaluating LLMs is critical to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and potential risks.
- Evaluation of LLMs focuses on what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate.
- Natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, natural language inference, and others are evaluated to assess LLMs' performance.
- LLMs are also evaluated for their reasoning abilities, including mathematical reasoning, common sense reasoning, and professional field reasoning.
- Natural language generation tasks, such as summarization, dialogue generation, translation, and question answering, are evaluated to measure the quality of LLMs' output.
- Multilingual tasks assess LLMs' performance in different languages, highlighting challenges in non-Latin languages and low-resource languages.
- Robustness, ethics, biases, and trustworthiness of LLMs are important evaluation aspects to ensure reliable and responsible AI systems.
- Evaluation of social science tasks enables the use of LLMs in addressing scaling and measurement issues in fields such as economics, sociology, and political science.
- Evaluation of natural science and engineering tasks, such as mathematics, science, and engineering domains, helps assess LLMs' capabilities in these specific areas.
