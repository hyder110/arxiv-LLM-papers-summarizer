Summary:
This article introduces an autonomous edge AI system that organizes, adapts, and optimizes itself to meet users' diverse requirements. It employs a hierarchical architecture, where a large language model (GPT) resides in the cloud, and other AI models are co-deployed on devices and edge servers. The system uses GPT for language understanding, planning, and code generation, and demonstrates the ability to accurately comprehend user demands, execute AI models efficiently, and create high-performance models through federated learning. The article highlights the importance of connected intelligence in future networks and the potential of GPT in achieving autonomous edge AI.
