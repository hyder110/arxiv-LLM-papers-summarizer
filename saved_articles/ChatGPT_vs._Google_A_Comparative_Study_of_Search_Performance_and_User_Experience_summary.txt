Summary:

This study compared the search performance and user experience of ChatGPT, a large language model-powered chatbot, with Google Search. A randomized online experiment was conducted with participants divided into two groups: one using ChatGPT and the other using Google Search. 

The findings showed that the ChatGPT group spent less time on all tasks, but there was no significant difference in overall task performance compared to the Google Search group. ChatGPT performed well in answering straightforward questions and providing general solutions but struggled with fact-checking tasks.

Participants perceived ChatGPT's responses to have higher information quality compared to Google Search, despite having a similar level of trust in both tools. They also reported significantly better user experiences in terms of usefulness, enjoyment, and satisfaction when using ChatGPT.

However, it was noted that ChatGPT may lead to overreliance and generate or replicate misinformation, resulting in inconsistent results.

The study provides insights for search engine management and highlights opportunities for integrating chatbot technologies into search engine designs.
