Summary:
This research explores the use of in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for biomedical concept linking. The proposed approach utilizes a two-stage retrieve-and-rank framework: embedding biomedical concepts using LLMs and then incorporating contextual information to re-rank the concepts. The approach achieved high accuracy in disease entity normalization and chemical entity normalization tasks, showing competitive performance compared to supervised learning methods. The framework also showed significant improvement in ontology matching tasks. While the approach has promising results, there are limitations such as slow inference speed and resource-intensive requirements.
