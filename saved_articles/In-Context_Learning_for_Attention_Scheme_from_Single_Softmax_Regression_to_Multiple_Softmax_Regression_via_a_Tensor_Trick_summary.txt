Summary:

This paper explores in-context learning for attention-related regression problems in large language models (LLMs). The authors investigate the normalized version and rescaled version of the regression problem. They adopt a matrix formulation for attention regression and utilize a tensor trick to turn multiple regression into a single regression problem. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of in-context learning phenomena and presents results concerning the Lipschitz analysis of the regression problem. The main results for the normalized and rescaled versions are derived through the Lipschitz analysis. The authors also provide additional results on the Lipschitz analysis for common loss functions.
