ABSTRACT
Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent years,
they still rely on explicit human instruction to identify the target objects or cate-
gories before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems lack the ability to
actively reason and comprehend implicit user intentions. In this work, we propose
a new segmentation task — reasoning segmentation . The task is designed to out-
put a segmentation mask given a complex and implicit query text. Furthermore,
we establish a benchmark comprising over one thousand image-instruction pairs,
incorporating intricate reasoning and world knowledge for evaluation purposes. Fi-
nally, we present LISA: large Language Instructed Segmentation Assistant, which
inherits the language generation capabilities of the multi-modal Large Language
Model (LLM) while also possessing the ability to produce segmentation masks. We
expand the original vocabulary with a <SEG> token and propose the embedding-
as-mask paradigm to unlock the segmentation capability. Remarkably, LISA can
handle cases involving: 1) complex reasoning; 2) world knowledge; 3) explanatory
answers; 4) multi-turn conversation. Also, it demonstrates robust zero-shot capabil-
ity when trained exclusively on reasoning-free datasets. In addition, fine-tuning the
model with merely 239 reasoning segmentation image-instruction pairs results in
further performance enhancement. Experiments show our method not only unlocks
new reasoning segmentation capabilities but also proves effective in both complex
reasoning segmentation and standard referring segmentation tasks. Code, models,
and demo are available at github.com/dvlab-research/LISA.

In daily life, users tend to issue direct commands like “Change the TV channel” to instruct a
robot, rather than providing explicit step-by-step instructions such as “Go to the table first, find
the TV remote, and then press the button to change the channel.” However, existing perception
systems consistently rely on humans to explicitly indicate target objects or pre-define categories
before executing visual recognition tasks. These systems lack the capacity to actively reason and
comprehend users’ intentions based on implicit instructions. This self-reasoning ability is crucial in
developing next-generation intelligent perception systems and holds substantial potential for industrial
applications, particularly in robotics.
In this work, we introduce a new segmentation task — reasoning segmentation , which requires
generating a binary segmentation mask based on an implicit query text involving complex reasoning .
Notably, the query text is not limited to a straightforward reference ( e.g., “the orange”), but a more
complicated description involving complex reasoning orworld knowledge (e.g., “the food with high
Vitamin C”). To accomplish this task, the model must possess two key abilities: 1) reasoning complex
andimplicit text queries jointly with the image; 2) producing segmentation masks.
Inspired by the exceptional capacity of the Large Language Model (LLM) to reason and comprehend
user intentions, we aim to leverage this capability to address the aforementioned first challenge.
However, while several studies have integrated robust reasoning capabilities into multi-modal LLMs
to accommodate visual input, the majority of these models primarily concentrate on text generation
tasks and still fall short in performing vision-centric tasks that necessitate fine-grained output formats,
such as segmentation masks.
In this work, we introduce LISA: a large Language Instructed Segmentation Assistant, a multi-modal
LLM capable of producing segmentation masks. To equip the multi-modal LLM with segmentation
abilities, we incorporate an additional token, i.e.,<SEG> , into the existing vocabulary. Upon generat-
ing the <SEG> token, its hidden embedding is further decoded into the corresponding segmentation
mask. By representing the segmentation mask as an embedding, LISA acquires segmentation ca-
pabilities and benefits from end-to-end training. Remarkably, LISA demonstrates robust zero-shot
abilities. Training the model solely on standard semantic segmentation and referring segmentation
datasets yields surprisingly effective performance on the complex reasoning segmentation task. Fur-
thermore, we find that LISA’s performance can be significantly enhanced by fine-tuning on just 239
image-instruction reasoning segmentation pairs. As illustrated in Fig. 1, LISA can handle various
scenarios, including: 1) complex reasoning; 2) world knowledge; 3) explanatory answers; and 4)
multi-turn conversations.
In addition, to validate the effectiveness, we establish a benchmark for reasoning segmentation
evaluation, called ReasonSeg . Comprising over one thousand image-instruction pairs, this benchmark
offers persuasive evaluation metrics for the task. To align more closely with practical applications,
we annotate the images from OpenImages (Kuznetsova et al., 2020) and ScanNetv2 (Dai et al., 2017)
with implicit text queries that necessitate complex reasoning.
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
•We introduce the reasoning segmentation task, which necessitates reasoning based on implicit
human instructions. This task emphasizes the importance of self-reasoning ability, crucial for
building a genuinely intelligent perception system.
•We establish a reasoning segmentation benchmark, ReasonSeg , containing over one thousand
image-instruction pairs. This benchmark is essential for evaluation and encourages the community
to develop new techniques.
•We present our model — LISA, which employs the embedding-as-mask paradigm to incorporate
new segmentation capabilities. LISA demonstrates robust zero-shot ability on the reasoning
segmentation task when trained on reasoning-free datasets and achieves further performance
boost by fine-tuning on just 239 image-instruction pairs involving reasoning. We believe LISA
will promote the development of perceptual intelligence and inspire new advancements in this
direction.
22 R ELATED WORK
2.1 I MAGE SEGMENTATION
Semantic segmentation aims to assign a class label to every pixel in an image. Numerous stud-
ies (Shelhamer et al., 2017; Noh et al., 2015; Badrinarayanan et al., 2017; Ronneberger et al., 2015;
Chen et al., 2018; Yu & Koltun, 2016; Liu et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2017; 2018a; Yang et al., 2018;
Fu et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2018b; Zhu et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2021; Lai
et al., 2021; Tian et al., 2022; 2023) have proposed diverse designs (such as encoder-decoder, dilated
convolution, pyramid pooling module, non-local operator, and more) to effectively encode semantic
information. Research on instance segmentation (He et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2021; Cheng et al.,
2022) and panoptic segmentation (Kirillov et al., 2019; Xiong et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2020; Li et al.,
2021) has introduced various architectural innovations for instance-level segmentation, including
DETR (Carion et al., 2020)-based structures, mask attention, and dynamic convolution. In recent
years, typical segmentation tasks have made significant progress and become increasingly mature.
Consequently, it is imperative to develop more intelligent interaction ways for image segmentation.
The referring segmentation task (Kazemzadeh et al., 2014; Nagaraja et al., 2016) enables interaction
with human language, aiming to segment the target object based on a given explicit text description.
Recently, Kirillov et al. (2023) introduced SAM, trained with billions of high-quality masks, support-
ing bounding boxes and points as prompts while demonstrating exceptional segmentation quality.
X-Decoder (Zou et al., 2023a) bridges vision and language, unifying multiple tasks within a single
model. SEEM (Zou et al., 2023b) further supports various human interaction methods, including text,
audio, and scribble. However, these studies primarily focus on addressing multi-task compatibility
and unification, neglecting the injection of new capabilities. In this work, we present LISA to tackle
the reasoning segmentation task and enhance existing visual segmentors with self-reasoning abilities.
2.2 M ULTI -MODAL LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL
Motivated by the remarkable reasoning abilities of LLMs, researchers are exploring ways to transfer
these capabilities into the vision domain, developing multi-modal LLMs. Flamingo (Alayrac et al.,
2022) employs a cross-attention structure to attend to visual contexts, enabling visual in-context
learning. Models such as BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023b) and mPLUG-OWL (Ye et al., 2023) propose
encoding image features with a visual encoder, which are then fed into the LLM alongside text
embeddings. Otter (Li et al., 2023a) further incorporates robust few-shot capabilities through in-
context instruction tuning on the proposed MIMIC-IT dataset. LLaV A (Liu et al., 2023b) and
MiniGPT-4 (Zhu et al., 2023) first conduct image-text feature alignment followed by instruction
tuning. Koh et al. (2023) also investigates image retrieval for LLMs. Moreover, numerous works (Wu
et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023b; Shen et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023c; Yang et al., 2023a) utilize
prompt engineering, connecting independent modules via API calls, but without the benefits of end-
to-end training. Recently, there have been studies examining the intersection between multi-modal
LLMs and vision tasks. VisionLLM (Wang et al., 2023) offers a flexible interaction interface for
multiple vision-centric tasks through instruction tuning but fails to fully exploit LLMs for complex
reasoning. Kosmos-2 (Peng et al., 2023) constructs large-scale data of grounded image-text pairs,
infusing grounding capabilities into LLMs. DetGPT (Pi et al., 2023) bridges the fixed multi-modal
LLM and open-vocabulary detector, enabling detection to be performed based on users’ instructions.
GPT4RoI (Zhang et al., 2023) introduces spatial boxes as input and trains the model on region-text
pairs. In contrast, our work aims to 1) efficiently inject segmentation capabilities into multi-modal
LLMs and 2) unlock self-reasoning abilities for current perception systems.
3 R EASONING SEGMENTATION
3.1 P ROBLEM DEFINITION
The reasoning segmentation task is to output a binary segmentation mask M, given an input image
ximgand an implicit query text instruction xtxt. The task shares a similar formulation with the
referring segmentation task (Kazemzadeh et al., 2014), but is far more challenging. The key distinction
lies in the complexity of the query text in reasoning segmentation. Instead of a straightforward phrase
(e.g., ”the trash can”), the query text may include more intricate expressions (e.g., ”something that

What object in the picture can provide a safe and enclosed space for a toddler to play in?Figure 2: Examples of the annotated image-instruction pairs. Left: short query. Right: long query.
the garbage should be put into”) or longer sentences (e.g., ”After cooking, consuming food, and
preparing for food, where can we throw away the rest of the food and scraps?”) that involve complex
reasoning or world knowledge.
3.2 B ENCHMARK
Given the lack of quantitative evaluation, it is imperative to establish a benchmark for the reasoning
segmentation task. To ensure reliable assessment, we have collected a diverse set of images from
OpenImages (Kuznetsova et al., 2020) and ScanNetv2 (Dai et al., 2017), annotating them with implicit
text instructions and high-quality target masks. To cover different scenarios, our text instructions
consist of two types: 1) short phrases; 2) long sentences; as illustrated in Figure 2. The resulting
ReasonSeg benchmark comprises a total of 1218 image-instruction pairs. This dataset is further
partitioned into three splits: train ,val, andtest , containing 239, 200, and 779 image-instruction
pairs, respectively. As the primary purpose of the benchmark is evaluation, the validation and testing
sets include a larger number of image-instruction samples.
4 O UR METHOD
In this section, we first introduce the model architecture in Sec. 4.1. After that, we elaborate on the
training data preparation and training parameters in Sec. 4.2.
4.1 A RCHITECTURE
Embedding as Mask. Most current multi-modal LLMs (such as LLaV A, Flamingo (Alayrac et al.,
2022), BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023b), Otter (Li et al., 2023a), etc.) support image and text as input and
text as output, but they cannot directly output fine-grained segmentation masks. VisionLLM (Wang
et al., 2023) offers a solution by parsing segmentation masks as sequences of polygons, enabling
the representation of segmentation masks as plain text and allowing end-to-end training within the
framework of existing multi-modal LLMs. However, end-to-end training with the polygon sequences
introduces optimization challenges and may compromise generalization ability unless a massive
amount of data and computational resources are employed. For instance, training a 7B model,
VisionLLM requires 4×8NVIDIA 80G A100 GPUs and 50 epochs, which is computationally
prohibitive. In contrast, training LISA-7B requires only 10,000 training steps on 8 NVIDIA 24G
3090 GPUs.
To this end, we propose the embedding-as-mask paradigm to infuse new segmentation capabilities
into the multi-modal LLM. The pipeline of our method is illustrated in Fig. 3. Specifically, we first
expand the original LLM vocabulary with a new token, i.e.,<SEG> , which signifies the request for
the segmentation output. Given a text instruction xtxtalong with the input image ximg, we feed
them into the multi-modal LLM F, which in turn outputs a text response ˆytxt. It can be formulated as
ˆytxt=F(ximg,xtxt). (1)
When the LLM intends to generate a binary segmentation mask, the output ˆytxtshould include a
<SEG> token. We then extract the last-layer embedding ˆhsegcorresponding to the <SEG> token and

apply an MLP projection layer γto obtain hseg. Simultaneously, the vision backbone Fencextracts
the visual embeddings ffrom the visual input ximg. Finally, hsegandfare fed to the decoder
Fdecto produce the final segmentation mask ˆM. The detailed structure of the decoder Fdecfollows
Kirillov et al. (2023). The process can be formulated as
hseg=γ(ˆhseg),f=Fenc(ximg),
ˆM=Fdec(hseg,f).(2)
Training Objectives. The model is trained end-to-end using the text generation loss Ltxtand
the segmentation mask loss Lmask . The overall objective Lis the weighted sum of these losses,
determined by λtxtandλmask :
L=λtxtLtxt+λmaskLmask. (3)
Specifically, Ltxtis the auto-regressive cross-entropy loss for text generation, and Lmask is the
mask loss, which encourages the model to produce high-quality segmentation results. To compute
Lmask , we employ a combination of per-pixel binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss and DICE loss, with
corresponding loss weights λbceandλdice. Given the ground-truth targets ytxtandM, these losses
can be formulated as:
Ltxt=CE(ˆytxt,ytxt),Lmask =λbceBCE (ˆM,M) +λdiceDICE (ˆM,M). (4)
4.2 T RAINING
Training Data Formulation. As illustrated in Fig. 4, our training data consists of three parts, all
of which are derived from widely-used public datasets. The details are as follows:
•Semantic Segmentation Dataset. Semantic segmentation datasets typically consist of images and
the corresponding multi-class labels. During training, we randomly choose several categories for
each image. To generate data that matches the format of visual question answering, we employ a
question-answer template like “ USER :<IMAGE> Can you segment the {CLASS NAME}in
this image? ASSISTANT :It is <SEG> .”, where {CLASS NAME}is the chosen category,
and<IMAGE> denotes the placeholder for tokens of image patches. The corresponding binary
segmentation mask is used as the ground truth to provide mask loss supervision. During training,
we also use other templates to generate the QA data to ensure data diversity. We adopt ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff, and LVIS-PACO part segmentation datasets.
•Vanilla Referring Segmentation Dataset. Referring segmentation datasets provide an input image
and an explicit short description of the target object. Thus, it is easy to convert them into question-
answer pairs using a template like “ USER :<IMAGE> Can you segment {description }in
this image? ASSISTANT :Sure, it is <SEG> .”, where {description }is the given
explicit description. For this part, we adopt refCOCO, refCOCO+, refCOCOg, and refCLEF
datasets.

Figure 4: The illustration of training data formulation from different types of data, including semantic
segmentation data, referring segmentation data, and visual question answering (VQA) data.
•Visual Question Answering Dataset. To preserve the original Visual Question Answering (VQA)
ability of the multi-modal LLM, we also include the VQA dataset during training. We directly use
the LLaV A-Instruct-150k data (Liu et al., 2023b) generated by GPT-4.
Notably, the training set does not include any reasoning segmentation sample. Instead, it only contains
samples where the target objects are explicitly indicated in the query texts. Surprisingly, even without
complex reasoning training data, LISA demonstrates impressive zero-shot ability on the ReasonSeg
benchmark. Moreover, we find that further performance boost could be yielded by finetuning the
model on only 239 image-instruction reasoning segmentation pairs.
Trainable Parameters. To preserve the generalization ability of the pre-trained multi-modal
LLMF(i.e.,LLaV A in our experiments), we leverage LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) to perform efficient
fine-tuning, and completely freeze the vision backbone Fenc. The decoder Fdecis fully fine-tuned.
Additionally, the word embeddings of the LLM and the projection layer of γare also trainable.
5 E XPERIMENT
5.1 E XPERIMENTAL SETTING
Network Architecture. Unless otherwise specified, we use LLaV A-7B-v1-1 or LLaV A-13B-v1-1
as the multi-modal LLM F, and adopt the ViT-H SAM backbone as the vision backbone Fenc. The
projection layer of γis an MLP with channels of [256, 4096, 4096].
Implementation Details. We adopt 8 NVIDIA 24G 3090 GPUs for training. The training scripts
are based on deepspeed (Rasley et al., 2020) engine. We use AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017)
optimizer with the learning rate and weight decay set to 0.0003 and 0, respectively. We also adopt
WarmupDecayLR as the learning rate scheduler, where the warmup iterations are set to 100. The
weights of the text generation loss λtxtgenand the mask loss λmask are set to 1.0and1.0, respectively,
and those of the bce loss λbceand the dice loss λdiceare set to 2.0and0.5, respectively. Besides, the
batch size per device is set to 2, and the gradient accumulation step is set to 10. During training, we
select at most 3 categories for each image in semantic segmentation datasets.

Datasets. As mentioned in Sec. 4.2, our training data is composed of three types of datasets: (1)
For the semantic segmentation dataset, we use ADE20K (Zhou et al., 2017) and COCO-Stuff (Caesar
et al., 2018). Besides, to enhance the segmentation results for some part of an object, we also use part
semantic segmentation datasets, including PACO-LVIS (Ramanathan et al., 2023), PartImageNet (He
et al., 2022), and PASCAL-Part (Chen et al., 2014); (2) For the referring segmentation dataset, we
use refCLEF, refCOCO, refCOCO+ (Kazemzadeh et al., 2014), and refCOCOg (Mao et al., 2016).
(3) For the visual question answering (VQA) dataset, we use LLaV A-Instruct-150k dataset (Liu
et al., 2023b). In order to avoid data leakage, we exclude the COCO samples whose images are
present in the refCOCO(+/g) validation sets during training. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that
by finetuning the model on only 239 samples of ReasonSeg image-instruction pairs, the model’s
performance can be further boosted.
Evaluation Metrics. We follow most previous works on referring segmentation (Kazemzadeh et al.,
2014; Mao et al., 2016) to adopt two metrics: gIoU and cIoU. gIoU is defined by the average of all
per-image Intersection-over-Unions (IoUs), while cIoU is defined by the cumulative intersection over
the cumulative union. Since cIoU is highly biased toward large-area objects and it fluctuates too
much, gIoU is preferred.
5.2 R EASONING SEGMENTATION RESULTS
The reasoning segmentation results are shown in Table 1. It is worth noting that existing works fail to
handle the task, but our model can accomplish the task involving complex reasoning with more than
20% gIoU performance boost. As mentioned before, the reasoning segmentation task is essentially
different from previous referring segmentation in that it requires the model to possess reasoning
ability or access world knowledge . Only by truly understanding the query, can the model do well in
the task. The existing works are limited to explicit referring and have no proper way to understand an
implicit query, but our model exploits multi-modal LLM to reach the goal.
Another finding is that LISA-13B outperforms the 7B counterpart substantially, especially on the long-
query scenarios, which indicates that the current performance bottleneck may still lie in understanding
the query text, and a stronger multi-modal LLM might lead to even better results.
5.3 V ANILLA REFERRING SEGMENTATION RESULTS
To show that our model is also competent in the vanilla referring segmentation task, we make a
comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods in Table 2. We evaluate the methods on refCOCO,
refCOCO+, refCOCOg validation and testing sets. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results across
various referring segmentation benchmarks.

Swin-L. We explain that SAM is trained with billions of high-quality masks, and thus yields a higher
metric than Mask2Former that is trained on merely the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014). We also
notice that even with Mask2Former, our framework achieves a decent performance on the reasoning
segmentation task, significantly outperforming previous works such as X-Decoder (Zou et al., 2023a).
This reveals the fact that the design choice of vision backbone is flexible and not limited to SAM.
SAM LoRA Fintuning. We also investigate the effectiveness of applying LoRA on SAM backbone.
In Table 3, we note that the performance of LoRA finetuned SAM backbone is inferior to that of the

frozen one. A potential reason is that fine-tuning impairs the generalization ability of the origianl
SAM model.
SAM Pre-trained Weight. To demonstrate the contribution of SAM pre-trained weight, we make a
comparison between Experiments 1 and 3 in Table 4. Without being initialized by SAM pre-trained
weight, the vision backbone is trained from scratch. This causes the performance falling behind that
of the baseline model substantially.
MLP vs. Linear Projection Layer. In experiments 2 and 3 of Table 4, we notice that making γan
MLP yields little performance decrease in gIoU, but a relatively higher performance in cIoU.
Contribution of All Types of Training Data. In Table 5, we show the contribution of each type of
data to the performance. It is worth noting that in Exp. 4, we do not use any semantic segmentation
dataset, and the performance drops a lot. We conjecture that semantic segmentation datasets provides
a large amount of ground-truth binary masks for training, since a multi-class label can induce multiple
binary masks. This shows that semantic segmentation datasets are crucial in training.
Instruction Rephrasing by GPT-3.5. During finetuning on the reasoning segmentation image-
instruction pairs, we rephrase the text instruction by GPT-3.5, and randomly choose one. The
comparison between Experiments 3 and 4 in Table 4 shows that the performance is increased by 2.2%
gIoU and 2.9% cIoU. This result verifies the effectiveness of such data augmentation.
5.5 Q UALITATIVE RESULTS
As depicted in Fig. 5, we provide a visual comparison with existing related works, including the
model for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSeg), referring segmentation (GRES), and the
generalist models for segmentation (X-Decoder and SEEM). These models fail to handle the displayed
cases with various errors, while our approach produces accurate and high-quality segmentation results.
6 C ONCLUSION
In this work, we have proposed a new segmentation task— reasoning segmentation . This task is
significantly more challenging than the vanilla referring segmentation task, as it requires the model to
actively reason based on implicit user instructions. To enable effective evaluation, we have introduced
9a benchmark for this task, namely ReasonSeg . We hope this benchmark will be beneficial for the
development of related technologies. Finally, we have presented our model — LISA. By employing
the embedding-as-mask paradigm, it injects new segmentation capabilities into current multi-modal
LLMs and performs surprisingly well on the reasoning segmentation task, even when trained on
reasoning-free datasets. Consequently, it demonstrates the ability to chat with segmentation mask
outputs in various scenarios. We believe our work will shed new light on the direction of combining
LLMs and vision-centric tasks.
