Summary:

This study compared the performance of a large language model (ChatGPT) and a regular expression (RegexT) in identifying overweight body condition scores (BCS) in veterinary clinical narratives. The precision of RegexT was higher than ChatGPT, but ChatGPT had a higher recall. Prompt engineering is needed to improve ChatGPT output. Large language models like ChatGPT have potential in automated data extraction but require careful implementation to avoid errors.

Bullet Points:

1. The study compared the ability of ChatGPT and RegexT to identify overweight body condition scores (BCS) in veterinary clinical narratives.
2. RegexT had higher precision than ChatGPT, but ChatGPT had higher recall.
3. Subtle prompt engineering is needed to improve ChatGPT output.
4. Large language models like ChatGPT present opportunities for automated data extraction in veterinary health informatics.
5. Obesity is a common and significant medical condition in companion animals.
6. The Small Animal Veterinary Surveillance Network (SAVSNET) collects electronic health records (EHRs) from veterinary practices.
7. Regular expressions have been used to detect fixed word-patterns in veterinary clinical narratives.
8. Large language models like ChatGPT, trained on vast datasets, can generate human-like responses to complex prompts.
9. ChatGPT accurately identified most overweight BCSs in the study, but occasionally produced false positives and failed to return appropriate answers.
10. Further research on prompt engineering and system optimization is needed to improve the precision and reliability of large language models in text mining of clinical records.
