Summary:
This paper presents JourneyDB, a large-scale dataset for generative image understanding. The dataset consists of 4 million diverse and high-quality generated images paired with their text prompts. The authors also design four benchmarks to evaluate the performance of generative image understanding models in terms of content and style interpretation. The benchmarks include prompt inversion, style retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering. The authors evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art multimodal models on JourneyDB and provide insights into their strengths and limitations in understanding generative content.
