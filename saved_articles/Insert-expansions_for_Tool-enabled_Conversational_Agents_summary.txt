Summary:

This paper explores the use of insert-expansions in tool-enabled conversational agents. It focuses on the concept of the user becoming the tool to provide necessary details and refine requests.

The paper discusses the sequence organization of dialog, specifically insert-expansions, which are used to shape final responses and reduce friction in interaction.

The concept of augmented language models, which incorporate tools such as search engines or calculators into their reasoning paths, is introduced.

The benefits of insert-expansions in tool-enabled conversational agents are explored, including avoiding side-tracking and improving chat outcomes.

The methodology involves a direct comparison between a vanilla conversational agent and an enabled bot with insert-expansion capabilities.

Human evaluations are used to assess the differences between the two types of conversational agents.

Two empirical studies are conducted, which involve participants interacting with both types of conversational agents and comparing their experiences.

The results indicate that insert-expansions in tool-enabled conversational agents provide benefits in the recommendation domain.
