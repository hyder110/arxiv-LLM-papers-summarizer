Summary:
This paper explores the verification of generative AI output in a non-deterministic, trustless, decentralized network. The authors generate millions of data samples using open source diffusion and large language models and analyze the outputs to provide empirical evidence for verification. They also release a new training dataset called ImageNet-Gen. With a majority vote between three independent verifiers, the authors show that they can detect image generated perceptual collisions in generated AI with high probability and low chance of intra-class collision. They also achieve 100% consensus using greedy methods or n-way beam searches for large language models. The paper identifies and minimizes the major sources of stochasticity and presents gossip and synchronization training techniques for verifiability.
