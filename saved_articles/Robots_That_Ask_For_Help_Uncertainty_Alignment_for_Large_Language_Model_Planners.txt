Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a wide range of promising capabil-
ities — from step-by-step planning to commonsense reasoning — that may provide
utility for robots, but remain prone to confidently hallucinated predictions. In this work,
we present KNOW NO, which is a framework for measuring and aligning the uncer-
tainty of LLM-based planners such that they know when they don’t know and ask for
help when needed. KNOW NObuilds on the theory of conformal prediction to provide
statistical guarantees on task completion while minimizing human help in complex
multi-step planning settings. Experiments across a variety of simulated and real robot
setups that involve tasks with different modes of ambiguity (e.g., from spatial to numeric
uncertainties, from human p
