Summary:

- The study assesses the ability of GPT-4, a large language model, to interpret novel literary metaphors.
- GPT-4 consistently produces detailed and incisive interpretations of these metaphors, despite not being exposed to them previously.
- Judges rated GPT-4's metaphor interpretations as superior to those provided by a group of college students.
- Both GPT-4 and humans exhibited sensitivity to the Gricean cooperative principle in interpreting reversed metaphors.
- The findings suggest that GPT-4 has acquired an emergent ability to interpret complex novel metaphors.

Keywords: metaphor, large language models, natural language processing, text generation, artificial intelligence

Relevant bullet points:
- GPT-4 can interpret novel literary metaphors.
- Judges rated GPT-4's metaphor interpretations as superior to those of college students.
- GPT-4 and humans show sensitivity to the Gricean cooperative principle in interpreting metaphors.
- GPT-4 outperforms other large language models in metaphor interpretation.
- It is unclear how GPT-4 interprets metaphors and whether it uses conceptual combination or analogy.
- GPT-4's ability to generate novel metaphors is still unknown.
- GPT-4 was not familiar with the metaphors used in the study.
- GPT-4's performance in interpreting metaphors extends its language abilities.
- Large language models have the potential to acquire human-like pragmatic skills.
- The study highlights the need for more transparency about training data and internal representations of AI models.
