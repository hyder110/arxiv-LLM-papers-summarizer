Summary:
ChatMOF is an autonomous AI system developed to predict and generate metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). It leverages a large-scale language model (gpt-3.5-turbo) to extract key details from textual inputs and provide appropriate responses, eliminating the need for structured queries. The system consists of three core components: an agent, a tool kit, and an evaluator, allowing for tasks such as data retrieval, property prediction, and structure generation. It showcases the potential of large language models (LLMs) in material science and has high accuracy in tasks such as data retrieval (95%) and property prediction (91%).
