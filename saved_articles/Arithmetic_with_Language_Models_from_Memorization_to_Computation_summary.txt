Summary:

This paper investigates the arithmetic computation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) trained on predicting the next token. The study focuses on binary addition and multiplication tasks, which require a small vocabulary and exhibit input/output discontinuities. The researchers successfully trained a light language model to learn these tasks and found that the computation takes place in the value space once the input token representation is mapped to an appropriate internal representation. The findings support the hypothesis that LLMs work as Encoding-Regression-Decoding machines.

Bullet Points:
1. Large language models (LLMs) have surprising problem-solving capabilities that require logic reasoning and advance information processing.
2. This study focuses on how a language model can perform arithmetic computations beyond its training data.
3. Binary addition and multiplication tasks are used as a test bed because they require a small vocabulary and have input/output discontinuities.
4. The researchers successfully trained a light language model to learn these tasks and found that the computation takes place in the value space.
5. The language model works as an Encoding-Regression-Decoding machine.
6. The experiments show that the language model can learn addition in less than 50 epochs and multiplication in about 250 epochs.
7. The results demonstrate that the language model can generalize well on unseen data.
8. An ablation study shows that positional embedding and attention layers are necessary for the language model's performance.
9. The study suggests that any task that can be solved by a neural network regressor can also be solved by a language model with the additional burden of learning encoding and decoding steps.
10. Future research aims to extend this work to other mathematical and reasoning tasks.
