Summary:
This paper proposes a novel framework for zero-shot medical image classification using a combination of ChatGPT and CLIP. The framework aims to provide explainable diagnosis by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate additional cues and knowledge beyond the category name. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various medical datasets. The results show improved accuracy in zero-shot classification tasks and increased interpretability.
