Numerical perspectives help people understand extreme and unfamiliar numbers (e.g., $330 billion is about
$1,000 per person in the United States). While research shows perspectives to be helpful, generating them
at scale is challenging both because it is difficult to identify what makes some analogies more helpful than
others, and because what is most helpful can vary based on the context in which a given number appears.
Here we present and compare three policies for large-scale perspective generation: a rule-based approach, a
crowdsourced system, and a model that uses Wikipedia data and semantic similarity (via BERT embeddings) to
generate context-specific perspectives. We find that the combination of these three approaches dominates any
single method, with different approaches excelling in different settings and users displaying heterogeneous
