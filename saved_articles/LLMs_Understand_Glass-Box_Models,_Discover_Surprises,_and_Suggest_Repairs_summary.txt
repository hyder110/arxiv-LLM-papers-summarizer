Summary:
This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and interpreting interpretable models, specifically Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). LLMs can provide model-level summaries and perform complex reasoning tasks by analyzing and summarizing each component graph of the GAM. They can also detect anomalies and suggest repairs in the models. The paper presents examples in healthcare to demonstrate the utility of LLMs in interpreting GAMs. The package TalkToEBM is introduced as an open-source LLM-GAM interface.

Bullet Points:
1. Large language models (LLMs) can effectively work with interpretable models such as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs).
2. LLMs can provide comprehensive model-level summaries without needing the entire model to fit in context.
3. LLMs can apply their extensive background knowledge to automate common tasks in data science, such as detecting anomalies, describing potential reasons for the anomalies, and suggesting repairs.
4. LLMs can understand and reason about individual graphs in GAMs by adopting a hierarchical approach.
5. LLMs with prior knowledge can detect surprises and anomalies that contradict expectations in interpretable models.
6. LLMs can be used as tools to automate important aspects of the data science process, especially when paired with statistical tools like GAMs.
7. The package TalkToEBM provides an open-source LLM-GAM interface.
8. LLMs can be sensitive to small variations in the presentation of graphs, and different choices of centering can affect LLM interpretation.
9. LLMs are more accurate and effective compared to previous language models like GPT-3.5 in interpreting and reasoning about graphs.
10. LLMs can be used to explain black-box models indirectly by interpreting explanations generated by methods like SHAP.
