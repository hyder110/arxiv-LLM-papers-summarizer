Summary:
This dissertation presents the results of a study on pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in the earliest stages of stellar evolution.

The main goal of the study is to understand the processes of star formation, formation of circumstellar disks, the structure of the circumstellar environment, and the interaction of the star-disk system.

Photometric and spectral variability of PMS stars is important for modeling star formation processes and tracing the stages of stellar evolution.

The study discusses the photometric and spectral variability as a method to study physical processes in PMS stars and the importance of high-resolution spectra in probing the physical state of circumstellar disks and accretion processes.

Interferometry in the near and mid-infrared regions is also mentioned as a method to determine the parameters of circumstellar disks and understand the relationship between the structure of the inner part of the disk and outbursts.

The study discusses the two types of outbursts observed in PMS stars, FU Ori and EX Lupi type, and the challenges in classifying and understanding these types of outbursts.

The variability of FUors may result from the superposition of variable accretion rates and time-variable extinction.

The study also discusses eclipses of UX Ori type and their prevalence in PMS stars, suggesting that UXor type variability is a widespread phenomenon.

The variability in weak line T Tauri stars, classical T Tauri stars, and Herbig Ae/Be stars is also mentioned, with periodic or aperiodic variability observed, often associated with the presence of spots or hot spots due to accretion from the circumstellar disk.
