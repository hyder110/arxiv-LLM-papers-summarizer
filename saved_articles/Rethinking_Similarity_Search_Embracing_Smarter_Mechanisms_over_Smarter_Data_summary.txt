Summary:

The paper proposes a shift in perspective for improving the effectiveness of similarity search by focusing on enhancing search mechanisms rather than just data quality. It highlights three novel avenues: exploiting implicit data structures and distributions, engaging users in an iterative feedback loop, and moving beyond a single query vector. 

Bullet points:

- The paper advocates for enhancing search mechanisms in addition to data quality.
- It identifies three novel avenues for redefining the similarity search problem: exploiting implicit data structures, engaging users in feedback loops, and considering multiple query vectors.
- The proposed approaches have gained relevance in applications such as large-scale language models, video clip retrieval, and data labeling.
- Leveraging implicit structures in data can improve search quality by adjusting the search to ensure the nearest neighbor belongs to the same class or cluster.
- Engaging users in the loop can improve the accuracy of similarity search results by incorporating user feedback without updating the entire database.
- Traditional similarity searches focus on identifying data points similar to a single query point, but there is a need to effectively handle similarity between sets of objects.
- Distribution-aware search leverages the inherent structure within vector data to enhance the quality of similarity searches.
- Leveraging global distribution in similarity searches can improve retrieval performance by considering the unique characteristics of the query within the dataset.
- Incorporating user-provided labels and user-defined functions can further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of similarity search results.
- Practical solutions for adapting data embeddings include parameterized embeddings and partial/lazy updates.
