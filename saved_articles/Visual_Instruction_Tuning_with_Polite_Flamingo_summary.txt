Summary:
This paper introduces Polite Flamingo, a multi-modal response rewriter that transforms raw annotations into a more polite format for vision-language datasets. The rewriter is trained to reconstruct high-quality responses from distorted counterparts. The PF-1M dataset is generated and used to fine-tune a multi-modal Large Language Model (LLM) named Clever Flamingo. The model demonstrates advantages in both multi-modal understanding and response politeness.

Bullet Points:
1. Polite Flamingo is a multi-modal response rewriter that transforms raw annotations into a more polite format.
2. Raw annotations in vision-language datasets are often too succinct and unformatted, resulting in reduced human preference.
3. Polite Flamingo is trained to reconstruct high-quality responses from distorted counterparts.
4. The PF-1M dataset is generated by applying Polite Flamingo to existing vision-language datasets after rigorous filtering.
5. Clever Flamingo, a multi-modal LLM, is fine-tuned using the PF-1M dataset.
6. Clever Flamingo outperforms other multi-modal LLMs in detailed image captioning tasks and multi-image reasoning tasks.
7. Clever Flamingo underperforms in response politeness compared to LLaVA series.
8. The paper proposes a novel method to curate raw vision-language datasets into visual instruction tuning data.
9. The paper introduces a U-shaped multi-stage visual instruction tuning pipeline and multi-turn augmentations to efficiently train the Clever Flamingo model.
10. The resulting model is evaluated using automated evaluators and human evaluations for multi-modal understanding and response politeness.
