Abstract
Opioid related aberrant behaviors (ORAB) present novel risk factors for opioid
overdose. Previously, ORAB have been mainly assessed by survey results and by
monitoring drug administrations. Such methods however, cannot scale up and do
not cover the entire spectrum of aberrant behaviors. On the other hand, ORAB
are widely documented in electronic health record notes. This paper introduces a
novel biomedical natural language processing benchmark dataset named ODD, for
ORAB Detection Dataset. ODD is an expert-annotated dataset comprising of more
than 750 publicly available EHR notes. ODD has been designed to identify ORAB
from patients’ EHR notes and classify them into nine categories; 1) Confirmed
Aberrant Behavior, 2) Suggested Aberrant Behavior, 3) Opioids, 4) Indication,
5) Diagnosed opioid dependency, 6) Benzodiapines, 7) Medication Changes, 8)
Central Nervous System-related, and 9) Social Determinants of Health. We ex-
plored two state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models (finetuning
pretrained language models and prompt-tuning approaches) to identify ORAB.
Experimental results show that the prompt-tuning models outperformed the fine-
tuning models in most cateogories and the gains were especially higher among
uncommon categories (Suggested aberrant behavior, Diagnosed opioid dependency
and Medication change). Although the best model achieved the highest 83.92% on
area under precision recall curve, uncommon classes (Suggested Aberrant Behavior,
Diagnosed Opioid Dependence, and Medication Change) still have a large room
for performance improvement.
1 Introduction
The opioid overdose (OOD) crisis has had a striking impact on the United States, not only threatening
citizens’ health [ 3] but also bringing about a substantial financial burden [ 12]. According to a report
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ 7], OOD accounted for 110,236 deaths in a single
year in 2022. In addition, fatal OOD and opioid use disorder (OUD) cost the United States $1.04
trillion in 2017 and that figure rose sharply to $1.5 trillion in 2021 [ 5]. Identifying patients at risk of
OOD could help prevent serious consequences [25].
Opioid-related aberrant behaviors (ORABs) are patient behaviors that may indicate prescription
medication abuse [ 11]. ORABs can be categorized into confirmed aberrant behavior and suggested
aberrant behavior [ 30,20,27]. Herein, confirmed aberrant behaviors have a clear evidence of
medication abuse and addiction while suggested aberrant behaviors do not have a clear evidence
[27]. Table 1 presents examples of such categories. Since ORABs have shown to be associated with
Preprint. Under review.arXiv:2307.02591v1  [cs.CL]  5 Jul 2023patients with drug abuse problems [ 42], assessment of ORABs has been recognized as beneficial in
evaluating the risk associated with opioid abuse [26] and OOD [39].

Reluctance to decrease opioid dosing once stablePreviously, ORABs have been
detected by monitoring opioid
administration (e.g., frequency
and dosage) [ 31] or self-reported
questionnaires [ 1,42]. How-
ever such measurements do not
include the full spectrum of
ORABs (e.g., medication shar-
ing, denying medication chang-
ing). In addition, patients can obtain opioids from multiple resources (e.g. illegal purchase and
medication sharing), which are not captured in the structured data. It has been known that ORABs
are widely described in EHR notes and natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used
to identify ORABs Lingeman et al. [23]. However, the previous study relied on a small amount of
annotated notes, which were not publicly available. Moreover, the previous work only considered
ORABs as a binary classification (present or not) and only explored traditional machine learning
models (e.g., support vector machine (SVM)).
This paper proposes ORAB detection that is a novel Biomedical NLP (BioNLP) task. We also
introduce an ORAB Detection Dataset (ODD) which is large-size ,expert-annotated , and multi-label
classification benchmark dataset corresponding to the task. For this, we first designed a robust
and comprehensive annotation guideline that labels text into nine categories which encompass
two types of ORABs (Confirmed Aberrant Behavior and Suggested Aberrant Behavior) and seven
types of auxiliary opioid-related information (Opioids, Indication, Diagnosed Opioid Dependency,
Benzodiapines, Medication Change, Central Nervous System Related, Social Determinant of Health).
Using the guideline, domain experts annotated 750 EHR notes of 500 opioid-treated patients extracted
from MIMIC-IV database [ 15]. Overall, we annotated 2,519 instances with 157 ORABs instances
(113 for Confirmed Aberrant Behavior and 44 for Suggested Aberrant Behavior).
Experiments conducted on two ORAB detection models based on state-of-the-art (SOTA) natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) models; traditional finetuning [ 9] and prompt-based tuning [ 41] approaches.
The experimental results on MIMIC showed that prompt-based tuning models surpass finetuning
models in almost all categories (eight out of nine). When the numbers of instances were less than
100 ( uncommon categories : Suggest Aberrant Behavior, Diagnosed Opioid Dependency, and
Medication Change), the performance improvement was greater, in particular, the Medication Change
and Suggest Aberrant Behavior classes achieve performance improvements of over 20%p and 7%p
respectively. Experimental codes are available at https://github.com/soon91jae/ORAB_MIMIC .
ODD will be published as soon as possible via PhysioNet1.
The main contributions of this paper can be organized as follows:
•This paper introduces a new Biomedical NLP (BioNLP) task ORAB detection for extracting
information related to a patient’s risk of opioid addiction and abuse from EHR notes. We
also curate a corresponding benchmark dataset, named ODD , an expert-annotated dataset
for the ORAB detection task.
•In this paper, we present the experimental results of two state-of-the-art NLP models as
baseline performances for the benchmark dataset. Moreover, we report comprehensive data
and error analyses to guide future studies in constructing improved models.
2 Related Work
NLP-based Opioid Abuse Analysis Recently, with the development of NLP technology, studies
have been actively conducted to analyze information relevant to opioid abuse and OOD from text
(e.g. EHR notes, social media) [ 32,6,14,48,34]. Studies have explored a broad range of NLP
techniques to identify OUD [ 48]. Zhu et al. [48] developed a keyword-based OUD detection model for
patients who have been treated with chronic opioid therapy. Their NLP models were able to uncover
OUD cases that would be missed using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes
1https://physionet.org
23961881241038519-2930-3940-4950-5960-69above 70Age248252FemaleMaleFigure 1: Socio-demographic statistics of the sampled patients.
alone. Singleton et al. [34] proposed a multiple-phase OUD detection approach using a combination
of dictionary and rule-based approaches. Blackley et al. [6]developed feature engineering-based
machine learning models. Herein, the authors demonstrated that the machine learning models
outperformed a rule-based one that utilizes keywords.
Other works adopted NLP to study factors associated with opioid abuse. Goodman-Meza et al.
[14] utilized text features such as term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), concept
unique identifier (CUI) embeddings, and word embeddings to analyze substances that contribute to
opioid overdose deaths. Sarker et al. [32] conducted a geospatial and temporal analysis of opioid-
related mentions in Twitter posts. They found a positive correlation between the rate of opioid
abuse-indicating posts and opioid misuse rates and county-level overdose death rates.
The ORAB detection task is similar to the studies above in that it analyzes drug abuse-related
information using NLP approaches. However, different from the previous studies that mainly
depend on keywords such as drug mentioning, the ORAB detection is a more challenging NLP task
considering that it needs to identify various and complex linguistic patterns such as trying to deceive
physicians [29] and emotional reaction on opioid prescription [23].
ORAB Risk Assessment and Detection Webster and Webster [42] introduced a risk management
tool that monitors ORABs by scoring a patient’s self-reports on risk factors (history of family and
personal substance abuse, history of preadolescent sexual abuse, and psychological illness) related to
substance abuse. Then, each patient is categorized into three risk levels (low risk, moderate risk, and
high risk) according to the sum of the scores. Other studies [ 33,36,18,38,31] suggest detecting
ORAB by relying on diagnostic criteria based on structured information such as the frequency of
opioid dosage, the number of opioid prescribers, and the number of pharmacies. Although the above
methodologies can detect patients at risk of ORABs with high precision, the recall was low [31].
The most relevant work is Lingeman et al. [23]. However, as described earlier, Lingeman et al. [23]’s
work relied on a small scaled EHR notes which is not publicly available. In contrast, ODD consists
of a larger size of EHR notes (750 EHR notes, six times larger than Lingeman et al. [23]’s dataset
of 121 EHR notes) which is publicly available. Furthermore, ODD’s annotation scheme provides
rich sub-categorized aberrant behaviors (suggested and confirmed) and additional opioid-related
information. In contrast, Lingeman et al. [23]’s study was designed as a binary classification task to
detect ORABs. Finally, we leverage the SOTA deep learning models that the previous work Lingeman
et al. [23] did not explore.
3 ORAB Detection Dataset
3.1 Data Collection
The source of the first dataset is made up of publicly available fully de-identified EHR notes of
the MIMIC-IV database [ 16]. ORABs are uncommon events. To increase the likelihood that
our annotated data incorporate ORABs, we sorted out patients at risk of opioid misuse based on
repetitive opioid use and diagnosis related to opioid misuse. Specifically, we first extracted EHR notes
mentioning opioids with the generic and brand name of opioid medications. In addition, we selected
patients diagnosed based on their ICD codes. Detailed information on opioid medications (and their
generic names), and ICD codes utilized for filtering EHR notes are presented in Appendix A.
Among 331,794 EHR notes of 299,712 patients in MIMIC-IV database, we found that approximately
57% of patients were prescribed opioids during their hospitalization. Then, we selected patients
who were repeatedly prescribed (more than twice) opioids. In addition, we chose patients who were

diagnosed with drug poisoning and drug dependence based on the ICD codes. Overall, there are
3,904 patients who are satisfied the aforementioned conditions. Among them, we randomly select 750
notes from a randomly sampled 500 patients for annotation. Figure 1 presents the socio-demographic
statistics of the sampled patients. Herein, we can notice that the number of male and female is
balanced.
3.2 Data Annotation
We first designed an annotation guideline in Section 3.2.1 to label each sentence in an EHR note into
nine categories as shown in Table 2. Herein, the categories contain two ORABs (confirmed aberrant
behavior and suggested aberrant behavior) and seven additional information that relevant to opioid
usage.
EHR notes were annotated independently by two domain experts by following the annotation
guidelines. Herein, the primary annotator annotated all EHR notes with eHOST [ 10] annotation tool.
The other annotator coded 100 of the EHRs of the primary annotator with the same environment to
compute inter-rater reliability with Cohen’s kappa [ 40]. As a result, the inter-rater reliability shows
strong agreement ( κ= 0.87) between the annotators.
3.2.1 Annotation Guideline
Confirmed aberrant behavior: This class refers to behavior that is more likely to lead to a
catastrophic adverse event. It is defined as evidence confirming the loss of control of opioid use,
specifically aberrant usage of opioid medications, including: 1) Aberrant use of opioids, such as
administration/consumption in a way other than described or self-escalating doses. 2) Evidence
suggesting or proving that the patient has been selling or giving away opioids to others, including
family members. 3) Use of opioids for a different indication other than the indication intended by the
prescriber. 4) Phrases suggesting current use of illicit or illicitly obtained substances or misuse of
legal substances (e.g. alcohol) other than prescription opioid medications.
Suggested aberrant behavior: This class refers to behavior implying patient distress related to
their opioid treatment. SAB includes three kinds of behavior that suggest potential misuse of opioids.
1) Patient attempt to get extra opioid medicine like requesting for early refill, asking for increasing
dosage, or reporting missing/stolen opioid medication. 2) Patient emotions toward opioids like a
request for a certain opioid medication use/change/increase. 3) Physician concerns.
Opioids: This class refers to the mention or listing of the name(s) of the opioid medication(s) that
the patient is currently prescribed or has just been newly prescribed.
Indication: This class indicates that patients are using opioids under instructions, such as using
opioids for pain, for treatment of opioid use disorder, etc.
4Diagnosed Opioid Dependence: It refers to patients who have the condition of being dependent
on opioids, has chronic opioid use, or are undergoing opioid titration.
Benzodiazepines: This class refers to co-prescribed benzodiazepines (a risk factor for accidental
opioid overdose [ 37]). In this case, the patient is simply being co-prescribed benzodiazepines (with
no noted evidence of abuse).
Medication Change: This class indicates that the physician makes changes to the patient’s opioid
regimen during this current encounter or that the patient’s opioid regimen has been changed since the
patient’s last encounter with the provider writing the note.
Central Nervous System Related: This is defined as central nervous system-related terms or terms
suggesting altered sensorium, including cognitive impairment, sedation, lightheadedness, intoxication,
and general term suggesting altered sensorium (e.g. “altered mental status”).
Social Determinants of Health: This class refers to the factors in the surroundings which impact
their well-being. Our dataset captured the following attributes:
• Marital status (single, married ...)
• Cohabitation status (live alone, lives with others ...)
• Educational level (college degree, high school diploma, no high school diploma ...)
• Socioeconomic status (retired, disabled, pension, working ...)
• Homelessness (past, present ...)

annotated categories and instances.
Herein, MIMIC dataset consist of
2,519 instances annotated from the
EHRs. Especially, we can notice
that ‘confirmed aberrant behavior’
and ‘suggested aberrant behavior’
in EHRs are relatively rare events
only accounting for 157 (5.89%);
113 (4.24%) for confirmed aberrant
behavior and 44 (1.65%) for sug-
gested aberrant behavior. The ‘Opi-
oid’ and ‘CNS-related’ are majority
classes accounting for over 77% of overall instances while the other categories are less than 10%
each.
4 Task Definition and Evaluation Criterion
Task Definition We can formulate ORAB detection as a multi-label classification task that
identifies whether an input text contains ORABs (Confirmed, and Suggested aberrant behaviors)
and information relevant to opioid usage. This is because all labels can co-occurred together in a
sentence.
Evaluation Criterion Previous study on NLP-based ORAB detection [ 23] utilizes accuracy as an
evaluation criterion. However, since the labels in the dataset are highly imbalanced (in Table 3), the
accuracy may mislead performance on rare labels since it can overestimate true negative cases [ 4].
Thus, as a main evaluation criterion, we adopt the Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) that
have widely utilized for the performance evaluation of the binary classifiers on highly biased labels
[28].

5 ORAB Detection Models
This section demonstrates pretrained Language Model (LM) based ORAB detections models; tra-
ditional fine-tuning model [ 47] and prompt-tuning model. The prompt-based finetuning model has
shown advantages in rare category classification (e.g. zero-shot or few-shot classification) [ 46].
Figure 2 demonstrates illustrative concepts of the ORAB detection models.
5.1 Finetuning Models
The most common way to construct classification models using a pretrained language model (LM) is
to employ finetuning, as illustrated in Figure 2(a). In this approach, the input text xis passed through
the fine-tuning model. The hidden representation vector of the first token ‘[CLS]’ ( h0) is then used
as input for the classifier. Here, Wcandbcrepresent the weight matrix and bias, respectively. The
classifier calculates the probability distribution over output labels yusing the following formula:
P(y|x) =sigmoid (Wc·h0+bc)
5.2 Prompt-based Finetuning Models
Although finetuning on pretrained LMs has been successfully applied to most of NLP tasks [ 9],
it is still known that finetuning still requires considerable annotated examples to achieve a high
performance [41, 46]. Thus, uncommon categories in ODD may be a performance bottleneck.
The widely recognized technique of prompt-based finetuning, as demonstrated in studies by Gao
et al. [13] and Yang et al. [45], utilizes a template to transform a downstream task into a language
modeling problem by incorporating masked language modeling and a predefined set of label words,
effectively enabling effective few-shot learning capabilities.
In this study, we utilize the full name of each class to curate the prompt text p. Specifically, the
prompts for each class are arranged in the same order as Table 1, following the template “[ ci
placeholder]? [MASK]” where cirepresents the name of the ithclass. The prompt text is then
concatenated with x, distinguished by a separator token “[SEP],” and fed into a prompt-based tuning
model.
Next, we calculate the probability that the language model (LM) output of the masked token corre-
sponding to each class would be a positive word or a negative word. Following the approach of Gao
et al. [13], we define the positive word as ‘yes’ and the negative word as ‘no’. Thus, the probability of
‘yes’ for the ithclassci(P(yci=‘yes’|x,p)) can be interpreted as the probability that ciis included
in the input text x, and vice versa.

6 Experiment
6.1 Experimental Environment
Experimental Models To verify the generalizability of experimental results, we prepared two
different LMs pretrained on Biomedical literacy; BioBERT [ 22] and BioClinicalBERT [ 2]2. Herein,
‘Finetune’ and ‘Prompt’ indicate an LM trained on ODD via finetuning (in Section 5.1) and prompt-
based finetuning (in Section 5.2) respectively.
Experimental Setting For the experiments, we conducted 5-fold cross-validation and report the
average performance and standard deviation. We adopted a loss function as a binary cross entropy for
finetuning models and categorical cross entropy for prompt-based finetuning models [ 21]. Moreover,
we selected the optimizer as AdamW [24].
Hyper-parameter Setting We conducted the grid search with the following range of possible
values for each hyper-parameter: {2e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5} for learning rate, {4, 8, 16} for batch size, {2,3,4}
for the number of epoch. Herein, we choose the hyper-parameters that achieved the best performance
on the first fold of the BioClinicalBERT finetune environment with the grid search. Finally, we chose
3e-5 for learning rate, 8 for batch size, and 3 for the number of epochs.
Others To evaluation the statistical significance in performance between models, we adopted
student’s t-test [ 35]. In all of the experiments, we keep the random seed as 0. Finally, all experiments
were performed on an NVIDIA P40 GPU with CentOS 7 version.
6.2 Experimental Results
Table 4 shows the experimental results of the five-fold cross-validation on the experimental models.
To sum up, the performance range shows [73.02-83.92] based on the macro average AUPRC over
the categories. Especially, prompt-based finetuning models outperformed the finetuning models in
both BioClinicalBERT and BioBERT with large margins of 4.00%p and 9.38%p respectively. Herein,
BioClinicalBERT-based models achieved a higher performance compared to BioBERT-based models.
These results are not surprising because the pre-training BioClinicalBERT’s corpora contain EHR
notes from MIMIC-III [ 17] that is the previous version of our target database MIMIC-IV and both
databases were collected from the same hospital.
On the other hand, the performance among the classes has a large gap. For example, in the BioClini-
calBERT finetuned model, the class with the highest performance (Central Nervous System Related)
2Note that, BioBERT is additionally trained BERT [ 9] on biomedical corpora and BioClinicalBERT is further
trained BioBERT using MIMIC-III [17] which is the previous version of MIMIC-IV .
7is 98.21, which is more than double the performance gap compared to 44.45 of the lowest class
(Medication Change). Herein, the performance gap between these classes is related to the number of
instances. For example, the dominant classes, Opioids, and Central Nervous System Related show
very high performance with scores of 97.09 and 98.21, respectively. However, it can be seen that the
detection performance of the uncommon categories is inferior showing 44.74 for Suggested Aberrant
Behavior, 69.85 for Diagnosed Opioid Dependency, and 44.45 for Medication Change. Moreover, we
can notice that the performance results show the same trend in BioBERT.
Overall, prompt-based finetuning contributes to enhanced performance in nearly all environments (17
out of 18 cases), with the sole exception being Central Nervous System Related on BioClinicalBERT,
where the performance difference was negligible (-0.03%p). The introduction of prompt-based fine-
tuning resulted in significant improvements, particularly in uncommon categories. The performance
of prompt-based finetuning on BioClinicalBERT and BioBERT increased by 7.04%p and 17.54%p
respectively in the Suggested Aberrant Behavior class. In the Diagnosed Opioid Dependence class,
the performance of prompt-based finetuning on BioClinicalBERT and BioBERT improved by 3.18%p
and 16.75%p, respectively. Lastly, in the Medication Change class, the performance saw a rise of
more than 20%p. Despite these advancements, further performance improvements are still needed for
uncommon categories.
7 Discussion
7.1 Error Analysis
We conducted an error analysis on the first fold of the BioClinicalBERT prompt-based finetuning
model. Especially, this paper focuses on error cases of the three uncommon categories: Suggested
Aberrant Behavior, Diagnosed Opioid Dependency, and Medication Change.
Firstly, regarding Suggested Aberrant Behavior, we identified a problem with insufficient data on
specific abnormal behavior patterns. For instance, consider the sentence “He is requesting IV
morphine for his chest pain.” This is a clear example of suggested aberrant behavior as the patient is
asking for a specific medication (IV morphine). However, due to a lack of similar pattern sentences
in the data, the model finds it challenging to learn these patterns.
Likewise, in the case of Medication Change, the sentence “The only exception being that his home
dilaudid 4mg was increased from every 6h to every 4h” represents a medication change due to
alterations in the drug administration time interval. In this instance, the ML model might overlook
the significance of the change in time intervals due to the scarcity of similar patterns.
Furthermore, when dealing with Diagnosed Opioid Dependency, we noticed that a model heavily
relies on specific keywords. For example, the sentence “Insulin Dependent DM c/b has peripheral
neuropathy...” was classified as opioid dependence, which is a misclassification. This error occurred
due to the reliance on the keyword ‘dependent’, despite the fact that insulin is not an opioid.
Finally, we observed some text requires commonsense to correctly predict the label. For example, the
text “3 pitcher sized cocktail daily,” indicates the patient is addicted to alcohol which is a confirmed
aberrant behavior. However, the prediction probability for this sentence is 0.31%, so the training
model totally fails to identify that this sentence stands for confirmed aberrant behavior. This is
because, different from other examples where keywords such as alcohol addiction and alcohol abuse
are presented, in order to understand the above example, it is understood that the 3 pitcher cocktail is
an excessive dose and daily consumption is clear evidence of alcohol abuse.
7.2 Merits & Demerits
Our research can have the following positive impacts. Firstly, the information extracted by ORAB
detection models can be utilized for various studies and systems aimed at addressing opioid abuse.
For instance, since ORABs serve as important evidence of OUD, they can be used as key features in
opioid risk monitoring systems. Improved OOD prediction can save people’s lives.
Additionally, this information can be leveraged to detect a patient’s risk of OOD or opioid addiction at
an earlier stage, thereby assisting in the prevention of fatal OOD cases. Consequently, by supporting
efforts to mitigate future opioid overdoses, our research would contribute to maintaining people’s
health.
8However, it is important to acknowledge that our work may have certain negative social impacts. As
previously mentioned, ORAB detection can be utilized to strengthen opioid monitoring systems, but
this may unintentionally encroach upon the autonomy of doctors [ 8]. Consequently, patients who
genuinely require opioids to manage their pain may encounter obstacles and challenges in obtaining
the necessary medications.
7.3 Limitation & Future Work
The ORAB detection task relies on EHR notes. Thus, if health providers do not recognize the patient’s
abnormal signs, they may not describe aberrant behaviors in a note. In this case, our approach cannot
detect ORABs. In the future, we will develop an algorithm that detects a wider spectrum of ORABs
by combining them with previous structured information-based methods.
Moreover, ORAB detection models still have limited performance in the uncommon categories. It
is necessary to improve performance through advanced NLP approaches data augmentation [ 43],
medical knowledge injection [ 45], or leveraging knowledge extracted from large language models
[19].
8 Conclusion
This paper introduces a novel BioNLP task called ORAB detection, which aims to identify two
ORAB categories and seven categories relevant to opioid usage from EHR notes. We also present the
associated benchmark dataset, ODD. The paper provides baseline models and their performances
on ODD. To this end, we trained two SOTA pretrained LMs using a fine-tuning approach and
prompt-based fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance in three uncommon
categories was notably lower compared to the other categories. However, we also discovered that
prompt-based fine-tuning can help mitigate this issue. Additionally, we provide various error analysis
results to guide future studies.
