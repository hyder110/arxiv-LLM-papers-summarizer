Summary:
This paper explores how expert knowledge can be used to improve the data-driven identification of causal graphs by proposing strategies to amend expert knowledge based on consistency properties. The authors report a case study using a large language model as an imperfect expert.

Bullet points:
1. Understanding causal relationships is important for accurate decision-making.
2. Causal discovery methods can uncover causal relationships from observed data.
3. One limitation of causal discovery methods is their ability to only recover the true graph up to a set of equivalent solutions.
4. Expert knowledge can be used to reduce uncertainty in causal graphs.
5. This work explores the use of imperfect experts, such as large language models, to improve causal discovery.
6. The authors propose strategies for incorporating imperfect expert knowledge based on consistency properties.
7. A greedy approach is introduced to optimize the use of expert knowledge.
8. The performance of the approach is evaluated using real data and various types of experts.
9. The results show that the approach effectively reduces uncertainty in the causal graphs.
10. Large language models show potential in aiding causal discovery, but more research is needed.
