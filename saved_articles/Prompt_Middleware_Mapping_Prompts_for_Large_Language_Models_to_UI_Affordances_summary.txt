Summary:
The paper presents Prompt Middleware, a framework for generating prompts for large language models (LLMs) based on user interface (UI) affordances. The framework includes static prompts (predefined prompts), template-based prompts (prompts generated from templates with fill-in options in the UI), and free-form prompts (created from scratch). The authors demonstrate the concept of Prompt Middleware through FeedbackBuffet, a writing assistant that generates feedback based on user input.

Bullet Points:
1. Prompt Middleware is a framework for generating prompts for large language models based on UI affordances.
2. The framework includes static prompts, template-based prompts, and free-form prompts.
3. Static prompts are predefined prompts generated by experts.
4. Template-based prompts use fill-in options in the UI to generate prompts.
5. Free-form prompts allow users to create prompts from scratch.
6. FeedbackBuffet is a writing assistant that uses template-based prompts to generate feedback for users.
7. The system integrates best practices of feedback design into the template.
8. FeedbackBuffet is implemented as a ReactJS web app.
9. The system demonstrates how templates can guide LLMs based on user-selected options in the UI.
10. Prompt Middleware can help developers integrate LLMs into UIs.
