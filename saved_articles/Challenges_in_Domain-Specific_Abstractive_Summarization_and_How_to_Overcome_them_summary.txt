Summary:

This paper discusses the challenges in domain-specific abstractive text summarization and proposes approaches to overcome them. The three main challenges identified are the quadratic complexity of transformer-based models, model hallucination, and domain shift. The paper provides a review of existing techniques relevant to domain-specific text summarization and discusses their effectiveness in addressing these challenges.

Bullet points:

- Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well with general-purpose data but have limitations in domain-specific text summarization.
- The main challenges in domain-specific abstractive text summarization are quadratic complexity, model hallucination, and domain shift.
- Quadratic complexity refers to the memory requirement of transformer-based models increasing exponentially with the length of the input text.
- Model hallucination is the generation of factually incorrect text by the model, which is problematic in domains like science and journalism.
- Domain shift occurs when the training and test corpus have different distributions, leading to poor performance on domain-specific text.
- Existing techniques for domain-specific text summarization include efficient transformers to reduce complexity, semantic evaluation metrics for better evaluation, and domain adaptation of language models.
- Efficient transformers like BigBird, Longformer Encoder-Decoder, Reformer, and Performers address the quadratic complexity issue by reducing memory requirements.
- Semantic evaluation metrics like METEOR and BERTScore provide a more meaningful evaluation of generated summaries.
- Hallucination detection and mitigation methods aim to identify and correct factually incorrect content in generated summaries.
- Domain adaptation techniques, such as fine-tuning, pre-training, and tokenization-based approaches, help adapt language models to domain-specific text.
