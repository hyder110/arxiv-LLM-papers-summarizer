Summary:

This paper presents a large-scale cross-dataset evaluation of hate speech detection models in social media. The researchers fine-tune language models on different hate speech datasets and compare their performance. They find that combining hate speech detection datasets leads to the development of more robust models. The unified dataset performs better than individual datasets, showing the importance of data diversity in hate speech detection.

Bullet Points:

- Hate speech detection in social media is a challenging task due to the increasing amount of user-generated content, evolving text, and sensitivity of the topics.
- The researchers perform a large-scale cross-dataset comparison to evaluate the generalizability of hate speech detection models trained on different datasets.
- They unify and gather multiple hate speech detection datasets, transforming them into binary and multiclass classification tasks.
- The unified dataset improves the performance of hate speech detection models compared to individual datasets, showing the importance of data diversity.
- The researchers also conduct an independent test set evaluation to assess the robustness of the models outside existing datasets.
- The results demonstrate that combining diverse datasets leads to more robust hate speech detection models.
- Language models specialized in social media, such as BERTweet and TimeLMs-21, outperform general-purpose models like BERT-base and RoBERTa-base in hate speech detection.
- The evaluation reveals the limitations of training models on specific datasets and the need for broader and more diverse training data.
- The study highlights the importance of developing robust hate speech detection models in order to address the ongoing challenge of hate speech online.
- Future work should include extending the analysis to languages other than English and investigating target group recognition in hate speech detection.
