Summary:
The paper introduces a framework called Align With Purpose (AWP) for enhancing specific properties in models trained with the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) criterion. The AWP framework adds an additional loss term to the CTC loss that prioritizes alignments according to a desired property. The method does not require any modifications to the CTC loss function and can be implemented using only a few lines of code. The framework is evaluated on two applications: low latency and minimum Word Error Rate (WER) optimization. Experimental results show that AWP successfully reduces latency and improves WER in ASR models.
