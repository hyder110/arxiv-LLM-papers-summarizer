Summary:

BATGPT is a large-scale language model developed by Wuhan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. It can generate natural and fluent text in response to various types of input.

The model utilizes a bidirectional autoregressive architecture to capture complex dependencies in natural language, making it effective in tasks like language generation, dialog systems, and question answering.

To enhance the model's alignment performance, a novel parameter expansion method and reinforcement learning from both AI and human feedback are employed during training.

BATGPT outperforms other Chinese-oriented language models on the CMMLU benchmark, demonstrating its versatility and high accuracy across different categories.

Despite its achievements, ongoing research and development are necessary to improve language models and address ethical considerations like bias and responsible use.
