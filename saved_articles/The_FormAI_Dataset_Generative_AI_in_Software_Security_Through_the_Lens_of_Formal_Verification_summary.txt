Summary:
This paper presents the FormAI dataset, a large collection of 112,000 AI-generated compilable and independent C programs with vulnerability classification. The dataset is generated by GPT-3.5-turbo and is labeled with the vulnerabilities found within the source code using formal verification methods. The dataset is suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of static and dynamic analysis tools. The identified vulnerabilities are associated with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) numbers. The paper also discusses the motivation behind the research, related work on AI-generated code and vulnerability detection, and existing databases for vulnerable C code. The paper concludes by introducing the Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC) module used for vulnerability verification.

Bullet points:
- The FormAI dataset consists of 112,000 AI-generated compilable C programs with vulnerability classification.
- The dataset is generated by GPT-3.5-turbo and is labeled with vulnerabilities using formal verification methods.
- The dataset includes programs with varying levels of complexity and covers tasks like network management, table games, encryption, and string manipulation.
- Formal verification using the ESBMC module ensures accurate vulnerability detection without false positives.
- The dataset is suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of static and dynamic analysis tools.
- The identified vulnerabilities are associated with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) numbers.
- Existing datasets for vulnerable C code often lack diversity and are limited in terms of vulnerabilities and program complexity.
- The paper highlights the limitations of AI-based code generation and the importance of understanding potential vulnerabilities.
- The use of LLMs in code generation can introduce security flaws, as shown in previous studies.
- The dataset aims to provide a comprehensive and diverse collection of AI-generated code for training and benchmarking LLMs and machine learning algorithms.
