Summary:
This paper presents a framework for improving text classification and translation of Nigerian Pidgin (Naija) by utilizing cross-lingual adaptive training. The authors collected a large-scale parallel English-Pidgin corpus and applied continual and task adaptive training to adapt a pre-trained model to the low-resource Pidgin language. The results show that English pre-trained language models outperform multilingual models on English-Pidgin tasks and that augmenting orthographic data and using task adaptive training with back-translation significantly improves model performance.

Bullet points:
- Developing spoken language processing systems for low-resource languages like Nigerian Pidgin poses challenges due to lack of data and resources.
- This paper proposes a framework of cross-lingual adaptive training for improving text classification and translation in Nigerian Pidgin.
- The authors collected a large-scale parallel English-Pidgin corpus for training language models.
- The framework includes continual adaptive training and task adaptive training with back-translation.
- English pre-trained language models are found to be more effective than multilingual models for English-Pidgin tasks.
- Augmenting orthographic data and using task adaptive training with back-translation significantly improves model performance.
- The paper also presents an analysis of orthographic variations in Nigerian Pidgin.
- The authors released a large-scale English-Pidgin dataset and synthetic sentence pairs generated using their framework.
- The results show improved performance in sentiment classification and translation tasks for Nigerian Pidgin.
- Cross-lingual adaptive training is identified as a promising approach for building effective spoken language systems for low-resource languages.
