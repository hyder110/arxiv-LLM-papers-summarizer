Summary:
This paper explores the potential of using large language models (LLM) and text-to-3D models in engineering design optimization. The authors propose a fully automated evolutionary design optimization framework using a text-to-3D asset network called Shap-E. They evaluate different approaches for representing text prompts in the optimization process and discuss the benefits of using natural language models in engineering tools. The study focuses on aerodynamic vehicle optimization, but the methods can be applied to other design optimization problems as well. The analysis of optimization results shows the importance of generating realistic and diverse designs and suggests the need for further research on the relationship between text prompt variations and resulting design variations.

Bullet Points:
1. Advances in generative AI enable large neural network models to produce 3D assets from text prompts.
2. This paper explores the potential of deep text-to-3D and text-to-text models in engineering design optimization.
3. Traditional design optimization of 3D geometries often uses numerical representations, but natural language presents new challenges.
4. The authors propose a fully automated evolutionary design optimization framework using the text-to-3D asset network Shap-E.
5. Different approaches for representing text prompts are evaluated: bag-of-words and tokenization methods.
6. Generated designs need to be within the object class of application and be both diverse and realistic.
7. Research is needed to establish causal relations between text prompt variations and resulting variations of 3D designs.
8. Geometric deep learning architectures enable the development of 3D deep-generative models for engineering tasks.
9. Learned design representations have advantages over traditional representations like splines or free form deformation.
10. The capability to extrapolate from training data and the interpretability of deep neural network representations are challenges in learned design models.
