Summary:
This paper discusses the potential of incorporating multi-agent generative artificial intelligence (AI) in wireless networks. The authors explore the limitations of cloud-based large language models (LLMs) and propose using on-device LLMs for collaborative planning and solving tasks in wireless networks. They also examine the architecture design of wireless multi-agent generative AI systems and identify key wireless technologies that can enable on-device LLMs. The paper highlights the benefits of wireless generative agents in intent-based networking and provides a case study on how on-device LLMs can contribute to solving network intents. The authors discuss potential challenges and outline a research roadmap for realizing the vision of wireless collective intelligence.
