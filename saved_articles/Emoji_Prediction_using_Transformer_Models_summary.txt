Summary:

This study proposes a transformer-based approach for emoji prediction using BERT, a widely-used pre-trained language model. The approach involves fine-tuning BERT on a large corpus of text containing both text and emojis to predict the most appropriate emoji for a given text. The experimental results show that the approach outperforms several state-of-the-art models in predicting emojis with an accuracy of over 75%. The study highlights potential applications in natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and social media marketing.
