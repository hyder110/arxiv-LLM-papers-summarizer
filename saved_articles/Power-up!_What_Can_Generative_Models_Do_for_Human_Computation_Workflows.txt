Weare amidst an explosionof artiﬁcial intelligenceresearch, partic ularly around large language models (LLMs).Thesemodels have
a range of applications across domains like medicine, ﬁnance, commonsense k nowledge graphs, and crowdsourcing. Investigation
into LLMs as part of crowdsourcing workﬂows remains an under-explor ed space. The crowdsourcing research community has pro-
duced a body of work investigating workﬂows and methods for managing co mplex tasks using hybrid human-AI methods. Within
crowdsourcing, the role of LLMs can be envisioned as akin to a cog in a la rger wheel of workﬂows. From an empirical standpoint,
littleis currently understood about how LLMs can improve the eﬀec tiveness of crowdsourcing workﬂows and how such workﬂows
can be evaluated. In this work, we present a vision for exploring this gap from the perspectives of various stakeholdersinvolved in
thecrowdsourcing paradigm—thetaskrequesters,crowdworker s,platforms,andend-users.Weidentifyjuncturesintypicalcrowd-
sourcing workﬂows at which the introduction of LLMs can play a beneﬁc ial role and propose means to augment existing design
patterns forcrowd work.

1 INTRODUCTIONAND BACKGROUND
Artiﬁcialintelligence(AI)researchisbeingreinvigorat edwithcurrentadvancesinlargelanguagemodels(LLMs).Si nce
their inception, LLMs have increased in size, eﬀectiveness , and applications.For instance, BERT[ 10],initially trained
for masked language prediction, has been applied to other do mains such as neural ranking [ 18,31] and document
classiﬁcation [ 2,22]. OpenAI’s1GPT family of models have been used in language tasks includi ng goal-oriented dia-
logue [17], patent claim generation [ 23], and story generation [ 29]. The most recent GPT variant, ChatGPT [ 32], has
seen an explosive growth in popularity, indicating the pote ntial for a promising future where LLMs are deployed as
workassistants.Duetosuchpowerfulgenerativecapabilit y,moreresearchershavestartedexploringgenerativeLLMs

generation [ 44] and scientiﬁc writing [ 16]. LLMs have also exhibited promising assistive capability in complex tasks
likecoding[ 13],drugdiscovery [ 28],and questiongeneration for educationneeds [ 39].
The common thread running through all variations in LLMs is t he need of high quality data for training and eval-
uation. Crowdsourcing has been widely adopted in machine le arning practice to obtain high-quality annotations by

relying on human intelligence [ 15,37]. Crowdsourcing is a paradigm in which researchers or other stakeholders re-
questtheparticipationof adistributedcrowd ofindividua ls, whocancontributewith theirknowledge, expertise, and
experience[ 12].Suchindividuals,called crowdworkers ,areaskedtocompleteavarietyoftasksinreturnformoneta ry

Morecomplexproblems,such as softwareengineering orsyst em design problems,requiretask workﬂows.
Crowdsourcing workﬂows are distinct patterns that manage how large-scale problems are decomposedinto smaller
tasks to be completed by workers. The crowd-powered word pro cessor Soylent applies the Find-Fix-Verify workﬂow
toproducehigh-qualitytextbyseparatingtasksintogener atingandreviewing text[ 6].TheIterate-and-Vote workﬂow
has been deployed in creating image descriptions, where wor kers are asked to write descriptions of images to assist
thosewho are blind [ 26].Subsequent voting tasks are usedto decideon theoptimal d escription.Chen et al. [ 9] intro-
duce CrowdMR, which combines the Map-Reduce workﬂow with crowdsourcing to facilitate the solving of pro blems
that require both human and machine intelligence, i.e., “AI -Hard" problems [ 42]. With CrowdForge, Kittur et al. [ 21]

ﬁnding that the current state of crowdsourcing processes ar e inadequate for providing the necessary adaptationthat
complexworkﬂows require.
Within crowdsourcing, the role of LLMs can be envisioned as a kin to a cog in a larger workﬂow. Typically, LLMs
are used for supporting individual writing or classiﬁcatio n tasks within a workﬂow, as previous examples expressed.

2 INCORPORATINGLARGE LANGUAGE MODELSINCROWDSOURCINGWOR KFLOWS
As LLMs are pre-trained on large text corpora, they show grea t capability in understanding context-speciﬁc seman-
tics.When further ﬁne-tuned for speciﬁcuses with addition al, smallerdatasets, highly eﬀective and domain-targeted
models can be produced.Additionally, someLLMs (e.g., BART [24],GPT-3 [ 8]) are also goodat generating responses
toinput queries, which can beﬂuent, human-like, and even pr ofessional. As it stands, LLMs have beeneﬀectively de-
ployed within multipledomains such as medicine [ 4], ﬁnance [ 43], and others requiring commonsense reasoning [ 7].

the performances they do [ 45]. Such opacity also makes it diﬃcult to track the factual err or of LLMs, which inhibits
the potential for improving the models [ 11]. Further, language models are known to capture several diﬀ erent forms
of biases [ 1,30,38]. Most existing LLMs tend to perform poorlyon tasks that req uire commonsense knowledge [ 33],
which is a common practice for children. Last but not least, c urrent language models achieve poor compositional
generalization [ 19], which is required for solving complex tasks. Noticeably, LLMs fall short in aspects that humans
aregoodat,e.g., commonsense reasoning [ 25]and complextaskplanning [ 3,40].PuttingLLMs intopracticerequires

2.1 The Lens ofComplexCrowdsourcing Workflows
LLMs can easily ﬁt into existing crowdsourcing workﬂows. Ta ke the Find-Fix-Verify workﬂow as an example. This
workﬂowiswell-suitedforwritingtasks,whetheritbeedit ing,revisions,ornewcontent.Eachstepisanopportunityt o

a workers wouldbe tasked with reading the story and ﬁnding an y errors, e.g., grammar, spelling, or false statements.

LLM can be deployed for ﬁnding the errors, a generative LLM ca n be used to produce repaired text, and yet another
classiﬁcation LLM can ﬁnish it all oﬀ as the veriﬁer. However , not all tasks take this form, or follow this particular
workﬂow. Adapting other workﬂows, i.e., Iterate-and-Vote or MapReduce, can be done in a similar manner. Even so,
adaptations such as these prompt the question: Once introdu ced,what are the eﬀects of LLMs within crowdsourcing
workﬂows for each stakeholder ofthecrowdsourcing process ?

creating a positive cycle that beneﬁts both crowd workers an d requesters. Further work is required to gain a better

2.2 Risk andOpportunity
Further consideration is needed regarding the transparenc y of LLMs versus humans. When crowd workers complete
tasks,suchasannotationorotherdecision-orientedvarie ties,requestershavethecapabilityofperformingafollow -up
with the workers to elicit reasoning for the outcomes provid ed. This is not a simple job for LLMs. While there exist
methods for model explainability [ 35,36,41], none have demonstrated a level of eﬀectiveness on par with what a
requester would achieve with a human-human conversation. T his same lack of transparency also has the potential
of confounding workﬂows at the worker level. For example, ta ke a scenario where an LLM is tasked with making a
prediction,andahumanworkertovalidatethepredictionof themodel,andthemodelprovidesapredictionthatisnot
inlinewithwhattheworkerexpectstosee.Insuchascenario ,theworkermaywanttointerrogatethemodeltogain
insight into why the prediction was made. However, there is c urrently no such clear way for the worker to request
such anexplanationfrom theLLM.
Also worth considering is the concept of accountability. Wh enever a machine is introduced into a system, be it a
factory,anairplane,oracrowdsourcingworkﬂow,thequest ionofaccountabilityrequiresdeﬁnition.AddingLLMsinto
