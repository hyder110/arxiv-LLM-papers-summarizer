Summary:

This paper presents a novel approach called LOAF-M2L for generating singable lyrics that are compatible with melodies. LOAF-M2L utilizes prompt-based length control and a new objective that captures the relationship between melody and lyrics. The model achieves better accuracy in line and syllable requirements compared to naive fine-tuning, without sacrificing text fluency. In subjective evaluations, LOAF-M2L demonstrates significant improvement in music-lyric compatibility and overall quality compared to the state-of-the-art models. The results highlight the importance of formatting learning for generating singable lyrics.
