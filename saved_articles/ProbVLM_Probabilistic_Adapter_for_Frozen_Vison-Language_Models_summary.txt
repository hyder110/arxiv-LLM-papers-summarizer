Summary:
- ProbVLM is a post-hoc method that estimates the probabilistic distribution of embeddings for frozen vision-language models.
- It addresses the problem of deterministic embeddings not reflecting the inherent ambiguity in the embedding space.
- ProbVLM estimates uncertainty in multi-modal embeddings for pre-trained models like CLIP and BLIP.
- It outperforms other methods in terms of calibration of embedding uncertainties in retrieval tasks.
- ProbVLM aids in active learning and model selection for VLMs.
- It visualizes embedding distributions using a large-scale pre-trained latent diffusion model.
