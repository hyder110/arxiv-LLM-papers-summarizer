Summary:
This paper presents a method for tracking the moments of macroparticles in particle-in-cell codes used in plasma simulations.
The coordinate transformations for moments where space and time coordinates are mixed are calculated using Schwartz distributions.
The moment tracking and coordinate transformation equations are tested by modeling the motion of uncharged particles in a circular orbit around a black hole.
The error in tracking moments is small and scales quadratically, and can be improved by including higher order moments.
By using moments to deposit charge back onto the grid, a full particle-in-cell code can be developed.
The article also discusses the different summation conventions and coordinates used in plasma simulations.
The Vlasov equation, which describes the dynamics of collisionless charged particles, is introduced.
A distributional representation of moments in terms of derivatives of Dirac delta functions is used to show the time evolution of moments.
The article calculates the coordinate transformations for moments between different coordinate systems.
The formula for the coordinate transformation of moments between coordinate systems that mix space and time coordinates is derived.
